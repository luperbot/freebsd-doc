We have already hinted on the *diversity* of networking. Many different
systems have to talk to each other. And they have to speak the same
language. They also have to *understand* the same language the same way.

People often think that *body language* is universal. But it is not.
Back in my early teens, my father took me to Bulgaria. We were sitting
at a table in a park in Sofia, when a vendor approached us trying to
sell us some roasted almonds.

I had not learned much Bulgarian by then, so, instead of saying no, I
shook my head from side to side, the “universal” body language for *no*.
The vendor quickly started serving us some almonds.

I then remembered I had been told that in Bulgaria shaking your head
sideways meant *yes*. Quickly, I started nodding my head up and down.
The vendor noticed, took his almonds, and walked away. To an uninformed
observer, I did not change the body language: I continued using the
language of shaking and nodding my head. What changed was the *meaning*
of the body language. At first, the vendor and I interpreted the same
language as having completely different meaning. I had to adjust my own
interpretation of that language so the vendor would understand.

It is the same with computers: The same symbols may have different, even
outright opposite meaning. Therefore, for two computers to understand
each other, they must not only agree on the same *language*, but on the
same *interpretation* of the language.
