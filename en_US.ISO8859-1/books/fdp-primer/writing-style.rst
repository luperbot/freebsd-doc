12.1.?Tips

Technical documentation can be improved by consistent use of several
principles. Most of these can be classified into three goals: *be
clear*, *be complete*, and *be concise*. These goals can conflict with
each other. Good writing consists of a balance between them.

12.1.1.?Be Clear
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clarity is extremely important. The reader may be a novice, or reading
the document in a second language. Strive for simple, uncomplicated text
that clearly explains the concepts.

Avoid flowery or embellished speech, jokes, or colloquial expressions.
Write as simply and clearly as possible. Simple text is easier to
understand and translate.

Keep explanations as short, simple, and clear as possible. Avoid empty
phrases like “in order to”, which usually just means “to”. Avoid
potentially patronizing words like “basically”. Avoid Latin terms like
“i.e.” or “cf.”, which may be unknown outside of academic or scientific
groups.

Write in a formal style. Avoid addressing the reader as “you”. For
example, say “copy the file to ``/tmp``” rather than “you can copy the
file to ``/tmp``”.

Give clear, correct, *tested* examples. A trivial example is better than
no example. A good example is better yet. Do not give bad examples,
identifiable by apologies or sentences like “but really it should never
be done that way”. Bad examples are worse than no examples. Give good
examples, because *even when warned not to use the example as shown*,
the reader will usually just use the example as shown.

Avoid *weasel words* like “should”, “might”, “try”, or “could”. These
words imply that the speaker is unsure of the facts, and create doubt in
the reader.

Similarly, give instructions as imperative commands: not “you should do
this”, but merely “do this”.

12.1.2.?Be Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not make assumptions about the reader's abilities or skill level.
Tell them what they need to know. Give links to other documents to
provide background information without having to recreate it. Put
yourself in the reader's place, anticipate the questions they will ask,
and answer them.

12.1.3.?Be Concise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While features should be documented completely, sometimes there is so
much information that the reader cannot easily find the specific detail
needed. The balance between being complete and being concise is a
challenge. One approach is to have an introduction, then a “quick start”
section that describes the most common situation, followed by an
in-depth reference section.
