    <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The BSD operating systems are not clones, but open source
      derivatives of AT&amp;T's Research <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark> operating system, which is also
      the ancestor of the modern <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark> System V.  This may surprise you.  How
      could that happen when AT&amp;T has never released its code as open
      source?</para>

    <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It is true that AT&amp;T <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark> is not open source, and in a copyright
      sense BSD is very definitely <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">not</emphasis> <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark>, but on the
      other hand, AT&amp;T has imported sources from other projects,
      noticeably the Computer Sciences Research Group (CSRG) of the University of
      California in Berkeley, CA.  Starting in 1976, the CSRG started
      releasing tapes of their software, calling them <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Berkeley
	Software Distribution</emphasis> or <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BSD</emphasis>.</para>

    <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Initial BSD releases consisted mainly of user programs, but that
      changed dramatically when the CSRG landed a contract with the Defense
      Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to upgrade the communications
      protocols on their network, ARPANET.  The new protocols were known as
      the <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Internet Protocols</emphasis>, later
      <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">TCP/IP</emphasis> after the most important protocols.  The
      first widely distributed implementation was part of 4.2BSD, in
      1982.</para>

    <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the course of the 1980s, a number of new workstation companies
      sprang up. Many preferred to license <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark> rather than developing
      operating systems for themselves.  In particular, Sun Microsystems
      licensed <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark> and implemented a version of 4.2BSD, which they called
      <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SunOS</trademark>.  When AT&amp;T themselves were allowed to sell <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark> commercially,
      they started with a somewhat bare-bones implementation called System
      III, to be quickly followed by System V.  The System V code base did not
      include networking, so all implementations included additional software
      from the BSD, including the TCP/IP software, but also utilities such as
      the <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">csh</emphasis> shell and the <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">vi</emphasis>
      editor.  Collectively, these enhancements were known as the
      <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Berkeley Extensions</emphasis>.</para>

    <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The BSD tapes contained AT&amp;T source code and thus required a
      <trademark xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="registered">UNIX</trademark> source license.  By 1990, the CSRG's funding was running out, and
      it faced closure. Some members of the group decided to release the BSD
      code, which was Open Source, without the AT&amp;T proprietary code.
      This finally happened with the <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Networking Tape 2</emphasis>,
      usually known as <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Net/2</emphasis>.  Net/2 was not a complete
      operating system: about 20% of the kernel code was missing.  One of the
      CSRG members, William F. Jolitz, wrote the remaining code and released
      it in early 1992 as <emphasis xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">386BSD</emphasis>.  At the same time,
      another group of ex-CSRG members formed a commercial company called
      <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.bsdi.com/">Berkeley Software Design Inc.</link>
      and released a beta version of an operating system called
      <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.bsdi.com/">BSD/386</link>, which was based on
      the same sources.  The name of the operating system was later changed
      to BSD/OS.</para>

    <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">386BSD never became a stable operating system.  Instead, two other
      projects split off from it in 1993:
      <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</link> and
      <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/index.html">FreeBSD</link>.  The two projects
      originally diverged due to differences in patience waiting for
      improvements to 386BSD: the NetBSD people started early in the year,
      and the first version of FreeBSD was not ready until the end of the
      year.  In the meantime, the code base had diverged sufficiently to
      make it difficult to merge.  In addition, the projects had different
      aims, as we will see below.  In 1996,
      <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/">OpenBSD</link> split off from

	    documentation project committer may correct typographical or
	    grammatical errors without review.  On the other hand, developers
	    making far-reaching or complicated changes are expected to submit
	    their changes for review before committing them.  In extreme
