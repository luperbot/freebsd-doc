	on FreeBSD via the <a xmlns="" class="package" href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/devel/p4/pkg-descr">devel/p4</a> port or can be

      is to obtain an account on the server.  If you already have a
      <code class="systemitem">FreeBSD.org</code>
      account, log into <code class="systemitem">freefall</code>, run the following
      command, and enter a password that is not the same as your FreeBSD
      login or any other SSH passphrase:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>/usr/local/bin/p4newuser</code></strong></pre><p>Of course if you do not have a <code class="systemitem">FreeBSD.org</code> account, you
      will need to coordinate with your sponsor.</p><div xmlns="" class="warning"><h3 class="admontitle">Warning: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An email will be sent to your FreeBSD address that contains
	the password you specified above in cleartext.  Be sure to
	change the password once your
	<span class="application">Perforce</span> account has been
	created!</p></div><p>The next step is to set the environment variables that
      <code class="command">p4</code> needs, and verify that it can connect to
      the server.  The <code class="envar">P4PORT</code> variable is required to
      be set for all operations, and specifies the appropriate
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> server to talk to.  For the
      FreeBSD project, set it like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>export P4PORT=perforce.freebsd.org:1666</code></strong></pre><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Users with shell access on the <code class="systemitem">FreeBSD.org</code> cluster may
	wish to tunnel the <span class="application">Perforce</span>
	client-server protocol via an SSH tunnel, in which case the
	above string should be set to
	<code class="literal">localhost</code>.</p></div><p>The FreeBSD server also requires that the <code class="envar">P4USER</code>
      and <code class="envar">P4PASSWD</code> variables be set.  Use the username
      and password from above, like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>export P4USER=<em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em></code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>export P4PASSWD=<em class="replaceable"><code>password</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>Test that this works by running the following
      command:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 info</code></strong></pre><p>This should return a list of information about the server.
      If it does not, check that you have the <code class="envar">P4PORT</code>
      variable set correctly.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="clients"></a>3. Clients</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="application">Perforce</span> provides access to the
      repository and tracks state on a per-client basis.  In
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> terms, a client is a
      specification that maps files and directories from the
      repository to the local machine.  Each user can have multiple
      clients, and each client can access different or overlapping
      parts of the repository.  The client also specifies the root
      directory of the file tree that it maps, and it specifies the
      machine that the tree lives on.  Thus, working on multiple
      machines requires that multiple clients be used.</p><p>Clients may be accessed via <code class="command">p4 client</code>.
      Running this command with no arguments will bring up a client
      template in an editor, allowing you to create a new client for
      your work.  The important fields in this template are explained
      below:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Client:</code></span></dt><dd><p>This is the name of the client spec.  It can be
	    anything you want, but it must be unique within the
	    <span class="application">Perforce</span> server.  A naming
	    convention that is commonly used is
	    <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em>_<em class="replaceable"><code>machinename</code></em></code>,
	    which makes it easy to identify clients when browsing
	    them.  A default name will be filled in that is just the
	    machine name.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Description:</code></span></dt><dd><p>This can contain a simple text description to help
	    identify the client.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Root:</code></span></dt><dd><p>This is the local directory that will serve as the
	    root directory of all the files in the client mapping.
	    This should be a unique location in your filesystem that
	    does not overlap with other files or
	    <span class="application">Perforce</span> clients.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Options:</code></span></dt><dd><p>Most of the default options are fine, though it is
	    usually a good idea to make sure that the
	    <code class="option">compress</code> and <code class="option">rmdir</code>
	    options are present and do not have a
	    <code class="literal">no</code> prefix on them.  Details about each
	    option are in the <span class="application">Perforce</span>
	    docs.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">LineEnd:</code></span></dt><dd><p>This handles CR-LF conversions and should be left to
	    the default unless you have special needs for it.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">View:</code></span></dt><dd><p>This is where the server-to-local file mappings go.
	    The default is</p><pre class="programlisting">//depot/... //<em class="replaceable"><code>client</code></em>/...</pre><p>This will map the entire
	    <span class="application">Perforce</span> repository to the
	    <code class="filename">Root</code> directory of your client.
	    <span class="emphasis"><em>DO NOT USE THIS DEFAULT!</em></span>  The FreeBSD
	    repo is huge, and trying to map and sync it all will take
	    an enormous amount of resources.  Instead, only map the
	    section of the repo that you intend to work on.  For
	    example, there is the smpng project tree at
	    <code class="filename">//depot/projects/smpng</code>.  A mapping
	    for this might look like:</p><pre class="programlisting">//depot/projects/smpng/... //<em class="replaceable"><code>client</code></em>/...</pre><p>The <code class="literal">...</code> should be taken literally.
	    It is a <span class="application">Perforce</span> idiom for
	    saying <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">this directory and all files and directories
	      below it.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>A Perforce <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">view</span>&#8221;</span> can contain multiple
	    mappings.  Say you want to map in both the SMPng tree and
	    the NFS tree.  Your View might look like:</p><pre class="programlisting">//depot/projects/smpng/... //<em class="replaceable"><code>client</code></em>/smpng/...
	  //depot/projects/nfs/... //<em class="replaceable"><code>client</code></em>/nfs/...</pre><p>Remember that the <em class="replaceable"><code>client</code></em> is
	    the name of the client that was specified in the
	    <code class="literal">Client</code> section, but in the
	    <code class="literal">View</code> it also resolves to the directory
	    that was specified in the <code class="literal">Root</code>
	    section.</p><p>Also note that the same file or directory cannot be
	    mapped multiple times in a single view.  The following is
	    illegal and will produce undefined results:</p><pre class="programlisting">//depot/projects/smpng/... //<em class="replaceable"><code>client</code></em>/smpng-foo/...
	  //depot/projects/smpng/... //<em class="replaceable"><code>client</code></em>/smpng-bar/...</pre><p>Views are a tricky part of the learning experience
	    with <span class="application">Perforce</span>, so do not be
	    afraid to ask questions.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Existing clients can be listed via <code class="command">p4
	clients</code>.  They can be viewed without being modified
      via <code class="command">p4 client -o
	<em class="replaceable"><code>clientname</code></em></code>.</p><p>Whenever you are interacting with files in
      <span class="application">Perforce</span>, the <code class="envar">P4CLIENT</code>
      environment variable must be set to the name of the client that
      you are using, like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>export P4CLIENT=<em class="replaceable"><code>myclientname</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>Note that client mappings in the repository are not
      exclusive; multiple clients can map in the same part of the
      repository.  This allows multiple people to access and modify
      the same parts of the repository, allowing a team of people to
      work together on the same code.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="syncing"></a>4. Syncing</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you have a client specification defined and the
      <code class="envar">P4CLIENT</code> variable set, the next step is to pull
      the files for that client down to your local machine.  This is
      done with <code class="command">p4 sync</code>, which instructs
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> to synchronize the local
      files in your client with the repository.  The first time it
      runs, it will download all of the files.  Subsequent runs will
      only download files that have changed since the previous run.
      This allows you to stay in sync with others whom you might be
      working with.</p><p>Sync operations only work on files that the
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> server knows has changed.
      If you change or delete a file locally without informing the
      server, doing a sync will not bring it back.  However, doing a
      <code class="command">p4 sync -f</code> will unconditionally sync all
      files, regardless of their state.  This is useful for resolving
      problems where you think that your tree might be corrupt.</p><p>You can sync a subset of your tree or client by specifying a
      relative path to the sync command.  For example, to only sync
      the <code class="filename">ufs</code> directory of the
      <code class="literal">smpng</code> project, you might do the
      following:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>cd <em class="replaceable"><code>projectroot</code></em>/smpng</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 sync src/sys/ufs/...</code></strong></pre><p>Specifying a local relative path works for many other
      <code class="command">p4</code> commands.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="branches"></a>5. Branches</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the strongest features of
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> is branching.  Branches are
      very cheap to create, and moving changes between related
      branches is very easy (as will be explained later).  Branches
      also allow you to do very experimental work in a sandbox-like
      environment, without having to worry about colliding with others
      or destabilizing the main tree.  They also provide insulation
      against mistakes while learning the
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> system.  With all of these
      benefits, it makes sense for each project to have its own
      branch, and we strongly encourage that with FreeBSD.  Frequent
      submits of changes to the server are also encouraged.</p><p>Similar to <span class="application">Subversion</span>, the
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> repository (the
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">depot</span>&#8221;</span>)  is a single flat tree.  Every file,
      whether a unique creation or a derivative from a branch, is
      accessible via a simple path under the server
      <code class="filename">//depot</code> directory.  When you create a
      branch, all you are doing is creating a new path under the
      <code class="filename">//depot</code>.  This is in sharp contrast to
      systems like CVS, where each branch lives in the same path as
      its parent.  With <span class="application">Perforce</span>, the
      server tracks the relationship between the files in the parent
      and child, but the files themselves live under their own
      paths.</p><p>The first step to creating a branch is to create a branch
      specification.  This is similar to a client specification, but
      is created via the command <code class="command">p4 branch
	<em class="replaceable"><code>branchname</code></em></code>.</p><p>The following important fields are explained:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Branch</code></span></dt><dd><p>The name of the branch.  It can be any name, but must
	    be unique within the repository.  The common convention in
	    FreeBSD is to use
	    <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em>_<em class="replaceable"><code>projectname</code></em>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Description</code></span></dt><dd><p>This can hold a simple text description to describe
	    the branch.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">View</code></span></dt><dd><p>This is the branch mapping.  Instead of mapping from
	    the depot to the local machine like a client map, it maps
	    between the branch parent and branch child in the depot.
	    For example, you might want to create a branch of the
	    smpng project.  The mapping might look like:</p><pre class="programlisting">//depot/projects/smpng/... //depot/projects/my-super-smpng/...</pre><p>Or, you might want to create a brand new branch off of
	    the stock FreeBSD sources:</p><pre class="programlisting">//depot/vendor/freebsd/... //depot/projects/my-new-project/...</pre><p>This will map the FreeBSD HEAD tree to your new
	    branch.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Creating the branch spec only saves the spec itself in the
      server, it does not modify the depot or change any files.  The
      directory that you specified in the branch is empty on the
      server until you populate it.</p><p>To populate your branch, first edit your client with
      <code class="command">p4 client</code> and make sure that the branch
      directory is mapped in your client.  You might need to add a
      <code class="literal">View</code> line like:</p><pre class="programlisting">//depot/projects/my-new-project/... //<em class="replaceable"><code>myclient</code></em>/my-new-project/...</pre><p>The next step is to run <code class="command">p4 integrate</code>, as
      described in the next section.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Integrations"></a>6. Integrations</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Integration</span>&#8221;</span> is the term used by
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> to describe the action of
      moving changes from one part of the depot to another.  It is
      most commonly done in conjunction with creating and maintaining
      branches.  An integration is done when you want to initially
      populate a branch, and it is done when you want to move
      subsequent changes in the branch from the parent to the child,
      or from the child to the parent.  A common example of this is
      periodically integrating changes from the vendor FreeBSD tree to
      your child branch tree, allowing you to keep up to date with
      changes in the FreeBSD tree.  The
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> server tracks the changes in
      each tree and knows when there are changes that can be
      integrated from one tree to another.</p><p>The common way to do an integration is with the following
      command:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 integrate -b <em class="replaceable"><code>branchname</code></em></code></strong></pre><p><em class="replaceable"><code>branchname</code></em> is the name given to a
      branch spec, as discussed in the previous section.  This command
      will instruct <span class="application">Perforce</span> to look for
      changes in the branch parent that are not yet in the child.
      From those changes it will prepare a list of diffs to move.  If
      the integration is being done for the first time on a branch
      (for example doing an initial population operation), then the
      parent files will simply be copied to the child location on the
      local machine.</p><p>Once the integration operation is done, you must run
      <code class="command">p4 resolve</code> to accept the changes and resolve
      possible conflicts.  Conflicts can arise from overlapping
      changes that happened in both the parent and child copy of a
      file.  Usually, however, there are no conflicts, and
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> can quickly figure out how
      to merge the changes together.  Use the following commands to do
      a resolve operation:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 resolve -as</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 resolve</code></strong></pre><p>The first invocation will instruct
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> to automatically merge the
      changes together and accept files that have no conflicts.  The
      second invocation will allow you to inspect each file that has a
      possible conflict and resolve it by hand if needed.</p><p>Once all of the integrated files have been resolved, they
      need to be committed back to the repository.  This is done via
      <code class="command">p4 submit</code>, explained in the next
      section.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="submit"></a>7. Submit</h2></div></div></div><p>Changes that are made locally should be committed back to
      the <span class="application">Perforce</span> server for safe keeping
      and so that others can access them.  This is done via
      <code class="command">p4 submit</code>.  When you run this command, it
      will open up a submit template in an editor.  FreeBSD has a custom
      template, and the important fields are described below:</p><pre class="programlisting">Description:

      you will be notified that the submit has been turned into a
      changelist that must be corrected and re-submitted.  Submits are
      atomic, so if one file fails, the entire submit is
      aborted.</p><p>Submits cannot be reverted, but they can be aborted while in
      the editor by exiting the editor without changing the
      <code class="literal">Description</code> text.
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> will complain about this the
      first time you do it and will put you back in the editor.
      Exiting the editor the second time will abort the operation.
      Reverting a submitted change is very difficult and is best
      handled on a case-by-case basis.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="editing"></a>8. Editing</h2></div></div></div><p>The state of each file in the client is tracked and saved on
      the server.  In order to avoid collisions from multiple people
      working on the same file at once,
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> tracks which files are
      opened for edit, and uses this to help with submit, sync, and
      integration operations later on.</p><p>To open a file for editing, use <code class="command">p4 edit</code>
      like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 edit <em class="replaceable"><code>filename</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>This marks the file on the server as being in the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>edit</em></span> state, which then allows it to be
      submitted after changes are made, or marks it for special
      handling when doing an integration or sync operation.  Note that
      editing is not exclusive in <span class="application">Perforce</span>.
      Multiple people can have the same file in the edit state (you
      will be informed of others when you run
      <code class="command">edit</code>), and you can submit your changes even
      when others are still editing the file.</p><p>When someone else submits a change to a file that you are
      editing, you will need to resolve his changes with yours before
      your submit will succeed.  The easiest way to do this is to
      either run a <code class="command">p4 sync</code> or <code class="command">p4
	submit</code> and let it fail with the conflict, then run
      <code class="command">p4 resolve</code> to manually resolve and accept his
      changes into your copy, then run <code class="command">p4 submit</code> to
      commit your changes to the repository.</p><p>If you have a file open for edit and you want to throw away
      your changes and revert it to its original state, run
      <code class="command">p4 revert</code> like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 revert <em class="replaceable"><code>filename</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>This resyncs the file to the contents of the server, and
      removes the edit attribute from the server.  Any local changes
      that you had will be lost.  This is quite useful when you have a
      made changes to a file but later decide that you do not want to
      keep them.</p><p>When a file is synced, it is marked read-only in the
      filesystem.  When you tell the server to open it for editing, it
      is changed to read-write on the filesystem.  While these
      permissions can easily be overridden by hand, they are meant to
      gently remind you that you should being using <code class="command">p4
	edit</code>.  Files that have local changes but are not in
      the edit state may get overwritten when doing a <code class="command">p4
	sync</code>.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="changes"></a>9. Changes, Descriptions, and History</h2></div></div></div><p>Changes to the <span class="application">Perforce</span> depot can

      <span class="application">Perforce</span>, either against local
      changes that have not been submitted yet, or between two trees
      (or within a branch) in the depot.  These are done with
      different commands, <code class="option">diff</code> and
      <code class="option">diff2</code>:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="command">p4 diff</code></span></dt><dd><p>This generates a diff of the local changes to files in
	    the edit state.  The <code class="option">-du</code> and
	    <code class="option">-dc</code> flags can be used to create unified
	    or context diffs, respectively, or the
	    <code class="envar">P4DIFF</code> environment variable can be set to a
	    local diff command to be used instead.  It is a very good
	    idea to use this command to review your changes before
	    submitting them.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="command">p4 diff2</code></span></dt><dd><p>This creates a diff between arbitrary files in the
	    depot, or between files specified in a branch spec.  The
	    diff operation takes place on the server, so
	    <code class="envar">P4DIFF</code> variable has no effect, though the
	    <code class="option">-du</code> and <code class="option">-dc</code> flags do
	    work.  The two forms of this command are:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 diff2 -b <em class="replaceable"><code>branchname</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>and</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 diff2 //depot/<em class="replaceable"><code>path1</code></em> //depot/<em class="replaceable"><code>path2</code></em></code></strong></pre></dd></dl></div><p>In all cases the diff will be written to the standard
      output.  Unfortunately, <span class="application">Perforce</span>
      produces a diff format that is slightly incompatible with the
      traditional Unix diff and patch tools.  Using the
      <code class="envar">P4DIFF</code> variable to point to the real <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span></a>
      tool can help this, but only for <code class="command">p4 diff</code>.
      The output of <code class="option">diff2</code> command must be
      post-processed to be useful (the <code class="option">-u</code> flag of
      <code class="option">diff2</code> will produce unified diffs that are
      somewhat compatible, but it does not include files that have
      been added or deleted).  There is a post-processing script at:
      <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/tools/tools/perforce/awkdiff?view=co" target="_top">https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/tools/tools/perforce/awkdiff?view=co</a></code>.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="add-rm-files"></a>11. Adding and Removing Files</h2></div></div></div><p>Integrating a branch will bring existing files into your
      tree, but you may still want to add new files or remove existing
      ones.  Adding files is easily done be creating the file and then
      running <code class="command">p4 add</code> like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 add <em class="replaceable"><code>filename</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>If you want to add a whole tree of files, run a command
      like:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>find . -type f | xargs p4 add</code></strong></pre><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="application">Perforce</span> can track UNIX
	symlinks too, so you can probably use
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="command">\! -type d</code></span>&#8221;</span> as the
	matching expression in <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=find&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">find</span>(1)</span></a> above.  We do not commit
	symlinks into the source tree of FreeBSD though, so this should
	not be necessary.</p></div><p>Doing a <code class="command">p4 submit</code> will then copy the file
      to the depot on the server.  It is very important to only add
      files, not directories.  Explicitly adding a directory will
      cause <span class="application">Perforce</span> to treat it like a
      file, which is not what you want.</p><p>Removing a file is just as easy with the
      <code class="command">p4</code> delete command like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 delete <em class="replaceable"><code>filename</code></em></code></strong></pre><p>This will mark the file for deletion from the depot the next
      time that a submit is run.  It will also remove the local copy
      of the file, so beware.</p><p>Of course, deleting a file does not actually remove it from
      the repository.</p><p>Deleted files can be resurrected by syncing them to a prior
      version.  The only way to permanently remove a file is to use
      <code class="command">p4 obliterate</code>.  This command is irreversible
      and expensive, so it is only available to those with admin
      access.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="working-with-diffs"></a>12. Working with Diffs</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes you might need to apply a diff from another source
      to a tree under <span class="application">Perforce</span> control.  If
      it is a large diff that affects lots of files, it might be
      inconvenient to manually run <code class="command">p4 edit</code> on each
      file.  There is a trick for making this easier.  First, make
      sure that no files are open on your client and that your tree is
      synced and up to date.  Then apply the diff using the normal
      tools, and coerce the permissions on the files if needed.  Then
      run the following commands:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 diff -se ... | xargs p4 edit</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 diff -sd ... | xargs p4 delete</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>find . -type f | xargs p4 add</code></strong></pre><p>The first command tells <span class="application">Perforce</span>
      to look for files that have changed, even if they are not open.
      The second command tells <span class="application">Perforce</span> to
      look for files that no longer exist on the local machine but do
      exist on the server.  The third command then attempts to add all
      of the files that it can find locally.  This is a very
      brute-force method, but it works because
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> will only add the files that
      it does not already know about.  The result of running these
      commands will be a set of files that are opened for edit,
      removal, or add, as appropriate.</p><p>Verify the active changelist with:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 changelist</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 diff -du</code></strong></pre><p>and just do a <code class="command">p4 submit</code> after
      that.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="renaming-files"></a>13. Renaming Files</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="application">Perforce</span> does not have a built-in
      way of renaming files or moving them to a different part of the
      tree.  Simply copying a file to the new location, doing a
      <code class="command">p4 add</code> on it, and a <code class="command">p4
	delete</code> on the old copy, works, but does not preserve
      change history of the file.  This can make future integrations
      with parents and children very bumpy, in fact.  A better method
      of dealing with this is to do a one-time, in-tree integration,
      like so:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 integrate -i <em class="replaceable"><code>oldfile</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>newfile</code></em></code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 resolve</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 delete <em class="replaceable"><code>oldfile</code></em></code></strong>
<code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>p4 submit</code></strong></pre><p>The integration will force
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> to keep a record of the
      relationship between the old and new names, which will assist it
      in future integrations.  The <code class="option">-i</code> flag tells it
      that it is a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">baseless</span>&#8221;</span> integration, meaning that
      there is no branch history available for it to use in the
      integration.  That is perfect for an integration like this, but
      should not be used for normal branch-based integrations.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="freebsd-cvs-and-p4"></a>14. Interactions Between FreeBSD Subversion and Perforce</h2></div></div></div><p>The FreeBSD <span class="application">Perforce</span> and
      <span class="application">Subversion</span> repositories are
      completely separate.  However, changes to Subversion are tracked
      at near-real-time in <span class="application">Perforce</span>.  Every
      2 minutes, the Subversion server is polled for updates in the
      HEAD branch, and those updates are committed to
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> in the
      <code class="filename">//depot/vendor/freebsd/...</code> tree.  This tree
      is then available for branching and integrating to derivative
      projects.  Any project that directly modifies that FreeBSD source
      code should have this tree as its branch parent (or grandparent,
      depending on the needs), and periodic integrations and syncs
      should be done so that your tree stays up to date and avoids
      conflicts with mainline development.</p><p>The bridge between Subversion and
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> is one-way; changes to
      Subversion will be reflected in
      <span class="application">Perforce</span>, but changes in Perforce
      will not be reflected in Subversion.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="offline-ops"></a>15. Offline Operation</h2></div></div></div><p>One weakness of <span class="application">Perforce</span> is that
      it assumes that network access to the server is always
      available.  Most state, history, and metadata is saved on the
      server, and there is no provision for replicating the server
      like there is with SVN.  It is possible to run a proxy server,
      but it only provides very limited utility for offline
      operation.</p><p>The best way to work offline is to make sure that your
      client has no open files and is fully synced before going
      offline.  Then when editing a file, manually change the
      permissions to read-write.  When you get back online, run the
      commands listed in the <a class="xref" href="#working-with-diffs" title="12. Working with Diffs">Section 12, &#8220;Working with Diffs&#8221;</a> to
      automatically identify files that have been edited, added, and
      removed.  It is quite common to be surprised by
      <span class="application">Perforce</span> overwriting a locally
      changed file that was not opened for edit, so be extra vigilant
      with this.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="soc"></a>16. Notes for Google Summer of Code</h2></div></div></div><p>Most FreeBSD projects under the Google Summer of Code program
