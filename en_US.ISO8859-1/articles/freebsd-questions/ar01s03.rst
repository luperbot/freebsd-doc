When you subscribed to FreeBSD-questions, you got a welcome message from
mailman. In this message, amongst other things, it told you how to
unsubscribe. Here is a typical message:

.. code:: literallayout

    Welcome to the freebsd-questions@freebsd.org mailing list!

    To post to this list, send your email to:

      freebsd-questions@freebsd.org

    General information about the mailing list is at:

      http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions

    If you ever want to unsubscribe or change your options (e.g., switch to
    or from digest mode, change your password, etc.), visit your
    subscription page at:

    http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/options/freebsd-questions/grog%40lemsi.de

    You can also make such adjustments via email by sending a message to:

      freebsd-questions-request@freebsd.org

    with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
    quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.

    You must know your password to change your options (including changing
    the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  It is:

      12345

    Normally, Mailman will remind you of your freebsd.org mailing list
    passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
    prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
    unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
    your options page that will email your current password to you.

From the URL specified in your “Welcome” message you may visit the
“Account management page” and enter a request to “Unsubscribe” you from
FreeBSD-questions mailing list.

A confirmation message will be sent to you from mailman; follow the
included instructions to finish unsubscribing.

If you have done this, and you still can not figure out what is going
on, send a message to ``<freebsd-questions-request@FreeBSD.org>``, and
they will sort things out for you. *Do not* send a message to
FreeBSD-questions: they can not help you.
