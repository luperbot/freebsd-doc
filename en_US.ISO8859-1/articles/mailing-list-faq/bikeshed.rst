Literally, a ``bikeshed`` is a small outdoor shelter into which one may
store one's two-wheeled form of transportation. However, in FreeBSD
parlance, the term refers to topics that are simple enough that (nearly)
anyone can offer an opinion about, and often (nearly) everyone does. The
genesis of this term is explained in more detail `in this
document <../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/misc.html#BIKESHED-PAINTING>`__.
You simply must have a working knowledge of this concept before posting
to any FreeBSD mailing list.

More generally, a bikeshed is a topic that will tend to generate
immediate meta-discussions and flames if you have not read up on their
past history.

Please help us to keep the mailing lists as useful for as many people as
possible by avoiding bikesheds whenever you can. Thanks.
