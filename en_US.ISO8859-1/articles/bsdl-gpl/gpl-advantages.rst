A common reason to use the GPL is when modifying or extending the gcc
compiler. This is particularly apt when working with one-off specialty
CPUs in environments where all software costs are likely to be
considered overhead, with minimal expectations that others will use the
resulting compiler.

The GPL is also attractive to small companies selling CDs in an
environment where "buy-low, sell-high" may still give the end-user a
very inexpensive product. It is also attractive to companies that expect
to survive by providing various forms of technical support, including
documentation, for the GPLed intellectual property world.

A less publicized and unintended use of the GPL is that it is very
favorable to large companies that want to undercut software companies.
In other words, the GPL is well suited for use as a marketing weapon,
potentially reducing overall economic benefit and contributing to
monopolistic behavior.

The GPL can present a real problem for those wishing to commercialize
and profit from software. For example, the GPL adds to the difficulty a
graduate student will have in directly forming a company to
commercialize his research results, or the difficulty a student will
have in joining a company on the assumption that a promising research
project will be commercialized.

For those who must work with statically-linked implementations of
multiple software standards, the GPL is often a poor license, because it
precludes using proprietary implementations of the standards. The GPL
thus minimizes the number of programs that can be built using a GPLed
standard. The GPL was intended to not provide a mechanism to develop a
standard on which one engineers proprietary products. (This does not
apply to Linux applications because they do not statically link, rather
they use a trap-based API.)

The GPL attempts to make programmers contribute to an evolving suite of
programs, then to compete in the distribution and support of this suite.
This situation is unrealistic for many required core system standards,
which may be applied in widely varying environments which require
commercial customization or integration with legacy standards under
existing (non-GPL) licenses. Real-time systems are often statically
linked, so the GPL and LGPL are definitely considered potential problems
by many embedded systems companies.

The GPL is an attempt to keep efforts, regardless of demand, at the
research and development stages. This maximizes the benefits to
researchers and developers, at an unknown cost to those who would
benefit from wider distribution.

The GPL was designed to keep research results from transitioning to
proprietary products. This step is often assumed to be the last step in
the traditional technology transfer pipeline and it is usually difficult
enough under the best of circumstances; the GPL was intended to make it
impossible.
