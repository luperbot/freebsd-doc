7.?Open Source licenses and the Orphaning Problem

One of the serious problems associated with proprietary software is
known as “orphaning”. This occurs when a single business failure or
change in a product strategy causes a huge pyramid of dependent systems
and companies to fail for reasons beyond their control. Decades of
experience have shown that the momentary size or success of a software
supplier is no guarantee that their software will remain available, as
current market conditions and strategies can change rapidly.

The GPL attempts to prevent orphaning by severing the link to
proprietary intellectual property.

A BSD license gives a small company the equivalent of software-in-escrow
without any legal complications or costs. If a BSD-licensed program
becomes orphaned, a company can simply take over, in a proprietary
manner, the program on which they are dependent. An even better
situation occurs when a BSD code-base is maintained by a small informal
consortium, since the development process is not dependent on the
survival of a single company or product line. The survivability of the
development team when they are mentally in the zone is much more
important than simple physical availability of the source code.
