      tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="pr-writing-tips"></a>4.1. Tips and Tricks for Writing a Good Problem Report</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not leave the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>&#8221;</span>

	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>&#8221;</span> is used for the
	    <code class="literal">Subject:</code> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the

	    the more you provide, the better.  For instance, what part
	    of the system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see
	    the problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of
	    <code class="literal">Synopsis: portupgrade is broken</code>, see
	    how much more informative this seems:
	    <code class="literal">Synopsis: port ports-mgmt/portupgrade coredumps
	      on -current</code>.  (In the case of ports, it is
	    especially helpful to have both the category and portname

	to create or unified diff
	and make sure to specify the exact SVN revision numbers of the
	files you modified so the developers who read your report will
	be able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or
	the base utilities, a patch against FreeBSD-CURRENT (the HEAD
	Subversion branch) is preferred since all new code should be
	applied and tested there first.  After appropriate or
	substantial testing has been done, the code will be
	merged/migrated to the FreeBSD-STABLE branch.</p><p>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of
	some email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will
	completely ruin anything intended to be part of a
	Makefile.</p><p>Do not send patches as attachments using
	<code class="command">Content-Transfer-Encoding:

	escaping and the entire patch will be useless.</p><p>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right&#8212;particularly when they fix the
	problem described in the PR&#8212;large patches and especially
	new code which may require substantial review before
	committing should be placed on a web or ftp server, and the
	URL should be included in the PR instead of the patch.
	Patches in email tend to get mangled,
	and the larger the patch, the harder it will be for
	interested parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on
	the web allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the
	entire patch in a followup to the original PR.  Finally, large
	patches simply increase the size of the database, since closed
	PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and simply
	marked as complete.</p><p>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="pr-writing-filling-template"></a>4.4. Filling out the Template</h3></div></div></div><p>In the email template only, you will find the following

		(such as standard C library <code class="literal">libc</code>),

		system or were added via the Ports Collection.  If you
		are unsure, you can do <code class="command">whereis
		  <em class="replaceable"><code>programname</code></em></code>.
		FreeBSD's convention for the Ports Collection is to

		<code class="filename">/usr/local</code>,
		although this can be overridden by a system
