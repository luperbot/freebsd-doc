Once the problem report has been filed, you will receive a confirmation
by email which will include the tracking number that was assigned to
your problem report and a URL you can use to check its status. With a
little luck, someone will take an interest in your problem and try to
address it, or, as the case may be, explain why it is not a problem. You
will be automatically notified of any change of status, and you will
receive copies of any comments or patches someone may attach to your
problem report's audit trail.

If someone requests additional information from you, or you remember or
discover something you did not mention in the initial report, please
submit a follow up. The number one reason for a bug not getting fixed is
lack of communication with the originator.

-  The easiest way is to use the comment option on the individual PR's
   web page, which you can reach from the `PR search
   page <https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/query.cgi>`__.

If the problem report remains open after the problem has gone away, just
add a comment saying that the problem report can be closed, and, if
possible, explaining how or when the problem was fixed.

Sometimes there is a delay of a week or two where the problem report
remains untouched, not assigned or commented on by anyone. This can
happen when there is an increased problem report backlog or during a
holiday season. When a problem report has not received attention after
several weeks, it is worth finding a committer particularly interested
in working on it.

There are a few ways to do so, ideally in the following order, with a
few days between attempting each communication channel:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="itemizedlist">

-  Find the relevant FreeBSD mailing list for the problem report from
   the `list in the
   Handbook <../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-MAIL>`__
   and send a message to that list asking about assistance or comments
   on the problem report.

-  Join the relevant IRC channels. A partial listing is here:
   https://wiki.freebsd.org/IrcChannels. Inform the people in that
   channel about the problem report and ask for assistance. Be patient
   and stay in the channel after posting, so that the people from
   different time zones around the world have a chance to catch up.

-  Find committers interested in the problem that was reported. If the
   problem was in a particular tool, binary, port, document, or source
   file, check the `SVN Repository <http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org>`__.
   Locate the last few committers who made substantive changes to the
   file, and try to reach them via IRC or email. A list of committers
   and their emails can be found in the `Contributors to
   FreeBSD <../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors>`__
   article.

Remember that these people are volunteers, just like maintainers and
users, so they might not be immediately available to assist with the
problem report. Patience and consistency in the follow-ups is highly
advised and appreciated. With enough care and effort dedicated to that
follow-up process, finding a committer to take care of the problem
report is just a matter of time.
