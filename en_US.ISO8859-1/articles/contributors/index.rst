-  *Hardware contributors:*

   The following individuals and businesses have generously contributed
   hardware for testing and device driver development/support:

   .. raw:: html

      <div class="itemizedlist">

   -  BSDi for providing the Pentium P5-90 and 486/DX2-66 EISA/VL
      systems that are being used for our development work, to say
      nothing of the network access and other donations of hardware
      resources.

   -  `Compaq <http://www.compaq.com>`__ has donated a variety of Alpha
      systems to the FreeBSD Project. Among the many generous donations
      are 4 AlphaStation DS10s, an AlphaServer DS20, AlphaServer 2100s,
      an AlphaServer 4100, 8 500Mhz Personal Workstations, 4 433Mhz
      Personal Workstations, and more! These machines are used for
      release engineering, package building, SMP development, and
      general development on the Alpha architecture.

   -  TRW Financial Systems, Inc. provided 130 PCs, three 68 GB file
      servers, twelve Ethernets, two routers and an ATM switch for
      debugging the diskless code.

   -  Dermot McDonnell donated the Toshiba XM3401B CDROM drive currently
      used in freefall.

   -  Chuck Robey ``<chuckr@glue.umd.edu>`` contributed his floppy tape
      streamer for experimental work.

   -  Larry Altneu ``<larry@ALR.COM>``, and Wilko Bulte
      ``<wilko@FreeBSD.org>``, provided Wangtek and Archive QIC-02 tape
      drives in order to improve the ``wt`` driver.

   -  Ernst Winter (`Deceased <http://berklix.org/ewinter/>`__)
      contributed a 2.88 MB floppy drive to the project. This will
      hopefully increase the pressure for rewriting the floppy disk
      driver.

   -  `Tekram Technologies <http://www.tekram.com/>`__ sent one each of
      their DC-390, DC-390U and DC-390F FAST and ULTRA SCSI host adapter
      cards for regression testing of the NCR and AMD drivers with their
      cards. They are also to be applauded for making driver sources for
      free operating systems available from their FTP server
      ``ftp://ftp.tekram.com/scsi/FreeBSD/``.

   -  Larry M. Augustin contributed not only a Symbios Sym8751S SCSI
      card, but also a set of data books, including one about the
      forthcoming Sym53c895 chip with Ultra-2 and LVD support, and the
      latest programming manual with information on how to safely use
      the advanced features of the latest Symbios SCSI chips. Thanks a
      lot!

   -  Christoph P. Kukulies ``<kuku@FreeBSD.org>`` donated an FX120 12
      speed Mitsumi CDROM drive for IDE CDROM driver development.

   -  Mike Tancsa ``<mike@sentex.ca>`` donated four various ATM PCI
      cards in order to help increase support of these cards as well as
      help support the development effort of the netatm ATM stack.

-  *Special contributors:*

   .. raw:: html

      <div class="itemizedlist">

   -  `BSDi <http://www.osd.bsdi.com/>`__ (formerly Walnut Creek CDROM)
      has donated almost more than we can say (see the 'About the
      FreeBSD Project' section of the `FreeBSD
      Handbook <../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html>`__
      for more details). In particular, we would like to thank them for
      the original hardware used for ``freefall.FreeBSD.org``, our
      primary development machine, and for ``thud.FreeBSD.org``, a
      testing and build box. We are also indebted to them for funding
      various contributors over the years and providing us with
      unrestricted use of their T1 connection to the Internet.

   -  The `interface business GmbH,
      Dresden <http://www.interface-business.de/>`__ has been patiently
      supporting J?rg Wunsch ``<joerg@FreeBSD.org>`` who has often
      preferred FreeBSD work over paid work, and used to fall back to
      their (quite expensive) EUnet Internet connection whenever his
      private connection became too slow or flaky to work with it...

   -  `Berkeley Software Design, Inc. <http://www.bsdi.com/>`__ has
      contributed their DOS emulator code to the remaining BSD world,
      which is used in the *doscmd* command.
