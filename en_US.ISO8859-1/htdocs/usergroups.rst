    The Global BSD User Groups organization was founded to help promote

    -  Assist in increasing awareness of smaller user groups in the
       community.
    -  Facilitate idea and resource sharing through common access to
       meeting presentation topics and materials.
    -  Increase exposure to other BSD projects where local user groups
       may have less member interest or experience.
    -  Offer a BSD user group for those without a local BUG.

    We are working on ways to provide remote participation through
    streaming video of presentations. You can check our
    `website <http://metabug.org/>`__ or contact us via
    `e-mail <mailto:info@metabug>`__.
