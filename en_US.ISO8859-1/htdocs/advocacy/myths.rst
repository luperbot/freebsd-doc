FreeBSD Advocacy Project
========================

As the BSD projects (DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD) have
grown in size, a number of persistent myths have grown up around them.
Some of these are perpetuated by well meaning but misguided individuals,
others by people pursuing their own agendas.

This page aims to dispel those myths while remaining as dispassionate as
possible.

    **Note:** Throughout this page, \`\`\*BSD'' refers to all four of
    the BSD Projects. Where a myth or response is specific to a
    particular project it is indicated as such.

    If you are aware of an omission or error on this page, please let
    the `FreeBSD documentation project mailing
    list <mailto:doc@freebsd.org>`__ know.

Myths
-----

\*BSD has a closed development model, it's more \`\`Cathedral'' than \`\`Bazaar''
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eric Raymond wrote an influential paper, \`\`\ `The Cathedral and the
Bazaar <http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/>`__'' in
which the Linux development model (and the model Eric used for
``fetchmail``) is held up as an example of how to do \`\`open''
development. By contrast, the model employed by \*BSD is often
characterized as closed.

The implicit value judgment is that \`\`bazaar'' (open) is good, and
\`\`cathedral'' (closed) is bad.

If anything, \*BSD's development model is probably **more** akin to the
\`\`bazaar'' that Eric describes than either Linux or ``fetchmail``.

Consider the following;

-  **All the \*BSD projects:** The current, bleeding edge source code
   for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD is available for anyone to download
   from the Internet, 24 hours a day. You don't need to wait for someone
   else to roll a release.

   **FreeBSD:** An installable snapshot of the current progress is made
   weekly. These snapshots can be installed exactly like an ordinary
   release, and do not require installation over an existing system.

   **OpenBSD:** Installable snapshots are generated daily and if Theo
   thinks they are good enough, he uploads them to the mirrors.

   Contrast this with Linux, where new kernel distributions are made
   available on an ad-hoc basis, and where the frequency of each Linux
   distribution release is at the whim of the individual vendor.

   There's none of the Linux fanfare every time a new kernel is
   released, simply because for most \*BSD users it is an every day
   event.

-  Anyone can submit patches, bug reports, documentation, and other
   contributions. They can do this by using a web based interface.

   Pointers to this system litter the documentation.

-  Not everyone can commit code changes to the \*BSD code. You need to
   be a *committer* first. Typically, people are offered \`\`commit
   privs'' after they have made a few well-thought out submissions to
   the project using Bugzilla or similar.

   This is identical to the Linux mechanism. Only one person is
   (notionally) allowed to change the Kernel, Linus. But specific areas
   (such as the networking code) are delegated to other people.

   *Aside: Nik (nik@FreeBSD.org) is a case in point. After making
   several submissions to the FreeBSD Documentation Project and web
   pages, he was offered \`\`commit privs'' so that he did not have to
   keep bothering other committers to commit the changes. He never had
   to ask for them, they were freely given.*

--------------

You cannot make your own distributions or derivative works of \*BSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can. You just need to say in the documentation and source files
where the code is derived from. A bunch of derivative projects exists:

-  `DragonflyBSD <http://www.dragonflybsd.org/>`__ started as a code
   fork from FreeBSD 4.X, but it has since its own user community and
   development goals.

-  `TrustedBSD <http://www.trustedbsd.org/>`__ provides a set of trusted
   operating system extensions to the FreeBSD operating system,
   targeting the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security
   Evaluation (CC). This project is still under development, and much of
   the code is destined to make its way back into the base FreeBSD
   operating system, but the development takes place separately.

-  `Hybrid Cluster <http://www.hybrid-cluster.com/>`__ is a web cluster,
   based on FreeBSD and ZFS, which provides data redundancy and
   automated load balancing of standard LAMP websites and applications.

-  `Frenzy <http://frenzy.org.ua/eng/>`__ is another live-CD
   distribution, but customized for administering tasks. It contains
   software for hardware tests, file system checks, security checks,
   network setup and analysis.

-  `PicoBSD <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=picobsd>`__ is a
   tailored distribution of FreeBSD that fits on a floppy. It is great
   for turning diskless 386 PC into a router or a network print server.
   It is a part of the FreeBSD source tree, see
   /usr/src/release/picobsd.

-  `NanoBSD <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/nanobsd/index.html>`__ is
   another project to produce reduced versions of FreeBSD to put it on a
   Compact Flash card or other mass storage. It is also a part of the
   FreeBSD source tree, see /usr/src/tools/tools/nanobsd.

-  `TinyBSD <http://code.google.com/p/tinybsd/>`__ is a set of tools
   made up of shell scripts designed to allow easy development of
   Embedded Systems based on FreeBSD.

-  `ThinBSD <http://thinbsd.zefyris.com/>`__ is a small FreeBSD based
   boot image that allows a standard PC to act as a diskless thin client
   for a Microsoft Windows RDP server or an X terminal. It is entirely
   configured via DHCP.

-  `PC-BSD <http://www.pcbsd.org/>`__ is a desktop oriented FreeBSD
   derivative. It is intended to be easy to install and well-supported
   by its community.

-  `DesktopBSD <http://www.desktopbsd.net/>`__ is another FreeBSD based
   operating system customized for desktop usability.

-  `Gentoo/FreeBSD <http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/bsd/fbsd/index.xml>`__
   is an effort by the Gentoo Project to port their complete
   administration facilities to take advantage of the reliable FreeBSD
   kernel and userland. This project is purely incomplete and
   experimental.

-  `Debian GNU/kFreeBSD <https://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/kFreeBSD>`__
   is a port of the Debian GNU userland tools to the FreeBSD kernel. It
   takes advantage of the devfs(8) implementation (versus three
   discordant Linux interfaces), security features (like jails, ipfw,
   and pf), and ZFS, among other things.

-  `m0n0wall <http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/>`__ is a FreeBSD based firewall
   system that has many of the features of expensive firewalls like web
   interface, reset to factory defaults, stateful packet filtering,
   NAT/PAT redirection, DHCP client and server, caching DNS forwarder
   and more.

-  `pfSense <http://www.pfsense.com>`__ is an open source firewall
   derived from the m0n0wall firewall system with several different
   goals and features, such as OpenBSD's Packet Filter (PF), FreeBSD
   6.1, ALTQ support for excellent packet queuing and finally an
   integrated package management system for extending the environment
   with new features.

-  The Whistle Interjet: A \`\`network appliance'' that acts as a
   router, web server, mailhost (and other functionality), and can be
   configured using a web browser. The underlying operating system is
   FreeBSD, and Whistle have contributed many of their code enhancements
   back to the FreeBSD project (while keeping enough of them proprietary
   that they can stay in business).

Similarly to DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD was not a standalone project, it
started as a spinoff from the NetBSD project, and has since evolved its
own distinctive approach.

--------------

\*BSD makes a great server, but a poor (UNIX?) desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\*BSD makes a great server. It also makes a great desktop. Many of the
requirements for a server (responsiveness under load, stability,
effective use of system resources) are the same requirements as for a
desktop machine.

\*BSD has access to the same desktop tools (KDE, GNOME, Firefox,
windowmanagers) as Linux. And \`\`office'' applications such as
OpenOffice suite work under \*BSD too.

--------------

The BSD codebase is old, outdated, and dying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the BSD codebase may be more than 20 years old, it is neither
outdated nor dying. Many professional users like the stability that
years of testing has provided FreeBSD.

`Technological enhancements <../features.html>`__ continue to be added
to \*BSD.

--------------

The \*BSD projects are at war with one another, splinter groups form each week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. While occasional advocacy may get a touch heated, the \*BSD flavors
continue to work with one another. FreeBSD's Alpha port was initially
heavily based on the work done by the NetBSD team. Both NetBSD and
OpenBSD used the FreeBSD ports collection to bootstrap their own port
sets. FreeBSD and NetBSD both integrate security fixes first discovered
by the OpenBSD team.

The FreeBSD and NetBSD projects separated more than ten years ago.
OpenBSD and DragonflyBSD are the only new BSD projects to split off in
the last ten years.

The \*BSD projects cooperate in other areas as well. For example, the
monthly publication `DaemonNews <http://www.daemonnews.org/>`__ is a
collaborative effort by members of all four projects.

--------------

You can't cluster \*BSD systems (parallel computing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following URLs should disprove this;

-  http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/ The Parallel Virtual Machine is nothing
   more than a software package that makes setting up a Cluster simple.
   The source code is freely available, and will run on FreeBSD without
   much problem.
-  http://people.freebsd.org/~brooks/papers/bsdcon2003/fbsdcluster/
   Brooks Davis's paper about the implementation of a FreeBSD cluster
   with more than 300 CPU's
-  http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/carp.html OpenBSD's Common Address
   Redundancy Protocol (CARP) to build redundant clusters at the level
   of the firewall
-  http://www.countersiege.com/doc/pfsync-carp A good explanation of
   CARP
-  http://pf4freebsd.love2party.net/carp.html OpenBSD's CARP ported to
   FreeBSD

Note, that `freebsd-cluster <mailto:freebsd-cluster@FreeBSD.org>`__
mailing list is available for further discussion about clustering of
FreeBSD.

--------------

There's no commercial support for \*BSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**FreeBSD:** The `FreeBSD Commercial Vendors
Page <../commercial/consult_bycat.html>`__ lists companies that offer
commercial support for FreeBSD.

The `FreeBSD Mall <http://www.freebsdmall.com>`__ also offer commercial
support, along with shirts, hats, books, software, and promotional
items.

For training, one might try `BSDMall.com <http://www.bsdmall.com/>`__,
but they sell other items too, like shirts, hats, books and software!
Definitely worth a look.

**OpenBSD:** The `OpenBSD Commercial Consulting
Page <http://www.openbsd.org/support.html>`__ lists companies that offer
commercial support for OpenBSD.

--------------

There are no applications for \*BSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The free software community started running on predominantly BSD systems
(SunOS and similar). \*BSD users can generally compile software written
for these systems without needing to make any changes.

In addition, each \*BSD project uses a \`\`ports'' system to make the
building of ported software much easier.

**FreeBSD:** There are currently more than 24,000 applications ready to
download and install in the FreeBSD ports collection. On i386 and AMD64,
the Linux emulation layer will also run the vast majority of Linux
applications. On the AMD64 and Itanium architectures there is a
compatibility layer to run 32-bit FreeBSD binaries.

**NetBSD:** The Linux emulation layer will run the vast majority of i386
Linux applications, and the majority of SunOS4 applications can be run
on a SPARCStation.

**OpenBSD:** There are currently more than 3700 applications ready to
download and install in the OpenBSD ports collection. The Linux
emulation layer will also run the vast majority of i386 Linux
applications, and the majority of SunOS4 applications can be run on a
SPARCStation.

Both NetBSD and OpenBSD are able to use applications in FreeBSD's ports
collection with minimal effort. Their lower number of ported
applications reflects this.

It is true that most companies when porting to PC Unix will choose Linux
first. Fortunately, \*BSD's Linux emulation layer will run these
programs (Acrobat, StarOffice, Mathematica, WordPerfect, Quake, Intel
ICC compiler, Compaq's Alpha compiler ...) with few, if any, problems.

As a historical note, the first version of Netscape Navigator that ran
on FreeBSD with Java support was the Linux version. Now you can also use
a native FreeBSD version of Mozilla with a native Java plugin, all
compiled conveniently from the ports!

--------------

\*BSD is better than (insert other system)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is user opinion only.

(insert some other system) is better than \*BSD
