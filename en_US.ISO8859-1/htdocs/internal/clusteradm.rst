Charter for the Cluster Administrators
======================================

Lead cluster administrator is a delegated officer role (aka. "hat") that
answers to the FreeBSD Core Team and ultimately the FreeBSD community at
large. This person shall have the operational authority over the FreeBSD
cluster infrastructure (to the extent that the Core Team can delegate
this authority) and will be responsible for the following in general:

-  Ensure the reliable operation of the Project's equipment and network
   resources.
-  Ensure that the Project's resources are suitably and effectively used
   to serve the Project's interests.
-  Ensure that reasonable security precautions and mitigations are
   implemented within the constraints of the nature of a highly
   distributed project.
-  Delegate to and coordinating with both the site-specific admin teams
   and the admins at large.
-  Ensure that standard operating procedures, rules, guidelines etc are
   documented and understandable.
-  Take measures to ensure that a competent administrator would be
   expected to be able to adopt a predecessor's work in a reasonable
   amount of time.
-  Contingency planning and implementation to ensure continuity across
   site specific problems (including donated site withdrawal or
   outages).
-  Keep the interested parties (Core Team, Security Team, FreeBSD
   Foundation, Port Management Team, etc), project members and community
   members appropriately informed.
-  Give timely and authoritive answers to questions, or a direct
   referral to the appropriate party.
-  Aid other hat wearers and cluster administrators to get their job
   done.
-  Where practical and appropriate, use the Project's own product as a
   proving ground.
-  Make sure that it is easy for developers to know what hardware
   resources they have access to for project purposes.

The lead cluster administrator answers to the FreeBSD Core Team. If a
party is unhappy with a position that the hat wearer takes and is unable
to change their mind, they may take the issue to the Core Team. The Core
Team has the final say in the matter. If the lead cluster administrator
is a member of the Core Team then a complaint may be made in confidence
via the core secretary or another member if desired.

Any of the following still require a sign-off from the Core Team:

-  New public facing services.
-  Planned withdrawal of public facing services.
-  New team members.

Notable interaction with other hats:

-  The lead cluster administrator will consult with the Security Officer
   and the Security Team where appropriate but will be responsible for
   making decisions. However, the Security Officer may respond to
   security emergencies involving project infrastructure as necessary.
-  The Port Management Team has a large resource footprint and
   arrangements will be made with them to effectively operate their
   resources within the constraints of the overall cluster operation.

Earmarked resources:

Some site resources are provided for specific purposes. Any such
earmarking or use restrictions will be documented to make sure such
resources are used as intended.
