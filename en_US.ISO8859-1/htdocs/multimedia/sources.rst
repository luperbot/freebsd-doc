   COMPLETE Hard Disk Encryption with FreeBSD, by Marc Schiesser Learn
   how to effectively protect not only your data but also your
   applications. Most technologies and techniques intended for securing
   digital data focus on protection while the machine is turned on
   mostly by defending against remote attacks. An attacker with physical
   access to the machine, however, can easily circumvent these defenses
   by reading out the contents of the storage medium on a different,
   fully accessible system or even compromise program code on it in
   order to leak encrypted information. Especially for mobile users,
   that threat is real. And for those carrying around sensitive data,
   the risk is most likely high. This talk will introduce a method of
   mitigating that particular risk by protecting not only the data
   through encryption, but also the applications and the operating
   system from being compromised while the machine is turned off.

   Ever since the University of California, Berkeley CSRG implemented
   the chroot(8) command and system call in its BSD operating system in
   1982, the community-developed BSD Unix derivatives have set the
   standard for the introduction of plurality to the
   conventionally-singular Unix computing model. Today's system
   operators and developers have an array of BSD-licensed multiplicity
   strategies at their disposal that offer various degrees of both
   isolation and virtualization when introducing plurality. This paper
   will survey current and experimental BSD multiplicity strategies
   including chroot, FreeBSD jail, NetBSD/Xen, Amazon EC2, compatlinux,
   GXemul and SIMH, plus experimental strategies such as FreeBSD BHyVe,
   compatmach, Usermode NetBSD, Dragonfly BSD vkernel, OpenBSD sysjail
   and NetBSD mult. As an applied survey, this paper will both
   categorize each multiplicity strategy by the Unix environment to
   which it introduces plurality and demonstrate the usage of the
   utilities relating to each solution.

   The FreeBSD kernel uses seven different types of locks to ensure
   proper access to the resources that it manages. This talk describes
   the hierarchy of these locks from the low-level and simple to the
   high-level and full-featured. The functionality of each type of lock
   is described along with the problem domain for which it is intended.
   The talk concludes by describing the witness system within the
   FreeBSD kernel that tracks the usage of all the locks in the system
   and reports any possible deadlocks that might occur because of
   improper acquisition ordering of locks.

   Security Event Audit is a facility to provide fine-grained,
   configurable logging of security-relevant events. Audit events are
   stored in trail files that can be used for postmortem analysis in
   case of system compromise. Once the system is compromised, an
   attacker has access to audit trail files and can modify or delete
   them. The auditdistd daemon's role is to distribute audit trail files
   to a remote system in a secure and reliable way.

   Bullet Cache is an in-memory cache server inspired by memcached, but
   with a twist: a powerful record tagging and bulk query facility,
   configurable multithreading models and a dump / cache prewarm option.
   This talk will have two parts: a technical description of Bullet
   Cache's implementation with focus on programming techniques and
   optimizations, and a description of usage scenarios with the focus on
   how it can help real-world applications (not limited to Web
   applications).

   The Zetabyte File System (ZFS) is a modern file system which combines
   traditional file system features like a POSIX file system interface
   with RAID and volume management functionality. Features such as
   snapshot management and file share management are all managed within
   the ZFS interface. This management interface provides a number of
   opportunities to simplify system management. In the Technical
   Computing Services Sub-division of The Aerospace Corporation we are
   taking advantage of these features in a number of different ways.
   This talk presents some of the more interesting ones.

   The PBI format (Push Button Installer) has been the default package
   management system for PC-BSD going on 5+ years now. However as we
   looked to the future it became apparent that it was greatly needing
   an overhaul to both improve its functionality, and expand its usage
   outside the scope of just PC-BSD. Among the areas needing improvement
   were how it dealt with identical libraries between applications, the
   heavy requirements from being implemented in QT/KDE, and lack of a
   digital verification mechanism.

   pfSense: 2.0 and beyond From firewall distribution to appliance
   building platform pfSense is a BSD licensed customized distribution
   of FreeBSD tailored for use as a firewall and router. In addition to
   being a powerful, flexible firewalling and routing platform, it
   includes a long list of related features and a package system
   allowing further expandability without adding bloat and potential
   security vulnerabilities to the base distribution. This session will
   start with an introduction to the project and its common uses, which
   have expanded considerably beyond firewalling. We will cover much of
   the new functionality coming in the 2.0 release, which contains
   significant enhancements to nearly every portion of the system as
   well as numerous new features. While the primary function of the
   project is a firewalling and routing platform, with changes coming in
   pfSense 2.0, it has also become an appliance building framework
   enabling the creation of customized special purpose appliances. The
   m0n0wall code where pfSense originated has proved popular for this
   purpose, with AskoziaPBX and FreeNAS also based upon it, in addition
   to a number of commercial solutions. The goal of this appliance
   building framework is to enable creation of projects such as these
   without having to fork and maintain another code base. The existing
   appliances, including a DNS server using TinyDNS, VoIP with
   FreeSWITCH, and others will be discussed. For those interested in
   creating appliances, an overview of the process will be provided
   along with references for additional information.

   GEOM based disk schedulers for FreeBSD The high cost of seek
   operations makes the throughput of disk devices very sensitive to the
   offered workload. A disk scheduler can then help reorder requests to
   improve the overall throughput of the device, or improve the service
   guarantees for individual users, or both. Research results in recent
   years have introduced, and proven the effectiveness of, a technique
   called "anticipatory scheduling". The basic idea behind this
   technique is that, in some cases, requests that cause a seek should
   not be served immediately; instead, the scheduler should wait for a
   short period of time in case other requests arrive that do not
   require a seek to be served. With many common workloads, dominated by
   sequential synchronous requests, the potential loss of throughput
   caused by the disk idling times is more than balanced by the overall
   reduction of seeks. While a fair amount of research on disk
   scheduling has been conducted on FreeBSD, the results were never
   integrated in the OS, perhaps because the various prototype
   implementations were very device-specific and operated within the
   device drivers. Ironically, anticipatory schedulers are instead a
   standard part of Linux kernels. This talk has two major
   contributions: First, we will show how, thanks to the flexibility of
   the GEOM architecture, an anticipatory disk scheduling framework has
   been implemented in FreeBSD with little or no modification to a
   GENERIC kernel. While these schedulers operate slightly above the
   layer where one would naturally put a scheduler, they can still
   achieve substantial performance improvements over the standard disk
   scheduler; in particular, even the simplest anticipatory schedulers
   can prevent the complete trashing of the disk performance that often
   occurs in presence of multiple processes accessing the disk.
   Secondly, we will discuss how the basic anticipatory scheduling
   technique can be used not only to improve the overall throughput of
   the disk, but also to give service guarantees to individual disk
   clients, a feature that is extremely important in practice e.g., when
   serving applications with pseudo-real-time constraints such as audio
   or video streaming ones. A prototype implementation of the scheduler
   that will be covered in the presentation is available at
   http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/FreeBSD/

   Quiet Computing with BSD Programming system hardware monitors for
   quiet computing In this talk, we will present a detailed overview of
   the features and common problems of microprocessor system hardware
   monitors as they relate to the topic of silent computing. In a
   nutshell, the topic of programmable fan control will be explored.
   Silent computing is an important subject as its practice reduces the
   amount of unnecessary stress and improves the motivation of the
   workforce, at home and in the office. Attendees will gain knowledge
   on how to effectively programme the chips to minimise fan noise and
   avoid system failure or shutdown during temperature fluctuations, as
   well as some basic principles regarding quiet computing. Shortly
   before the talk, a patch for programming the most popular chips (like
   those from Winbond) will be released for the OpenBSD operating
   system, although the talk itself will be more specific to the
   microprocessor system hardware monitors themselves, as opposed to the
   interfacing with thereof in modern operating systems like OpenBSD,
   NetBSD, DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD.

   Results of a Security Assessment of the TCP and IP protocols and
   Common implementation Strategies Fernando Gont will present the
   results of security assessment of the TCP and IP protocols carried
   out on behalf of the United Kingdom's Centre for the Protection of
   National Infrastructure (Centre for the Protection of National
   Infrastructure). His presentation will provide an overview of the
   aforementioned project, and will describe some of the new insights
   that were gained as a result of this project. Additionally, it will
   provide an overview of the state of affairs of the different TCP/IP
   implementations found in BSD operating systems with respect to the
   aforementioned issues. During the last twenty years, many
   vulnerabilities have been identified in the TCP/IP stacks of a number
   of systems. The discovery of these vulnerabilities led in most cases
   to reports being published by a number of CSIRTs and vendors, which
   helped to raise awareness about the threats and the best possible
   mitigations known at the time the reports were published. For some
   reason, much of the effort of the security community on the Internet
   protocols did not result in official documents (RFCs) being issued by
   the organization in charge of the standardization of the
   communication protocols in use by the Internet: the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF). This basically led to a situation in
   which "known" security problems have not always been addressed by all
   vendors. In addition, in many cases vendors have implemented quick
   "fixes" to the identified vulnerabilities without a careful analysis
   of their effectiveness and their impact on interoperability. As a
   result, producing a secure TCP/IP implementation nowadays is a very
   difficult task, in large part because of the hard task of identifying
   relevant documentation and differentiating between that which
   provides correct advisory, and that which provides misleading
   advisory based on inaccurate or wrong assumptions. During 2006, the
   United Kingdom's Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure
   embarked itself in an ambitious and arduous project: performing a
   security assessment of the TCP and IP protocols. The project did not
   limit itself to an analysis of the relevant IETF specifications, but
   also included an analysis of common implementation strategies found
   in the most popular TCP and IP implementations. The result of the
   project was a set of documents which identifies possible threats for
   the TCP and IP protocols and, where possible, proposes
   counter-measures to mitigate the identified threats. This
   presentation will will describe some of the new insights that were
   gained as a result of this project. Additionally, it will provide an
   overview of the state of affairs of the different TCP/IP
   implementations found in BSD operating systems.

   Isolating Cluster Jobs for Performance and Predictability At The
   Aerospace Corporation, we run a large FreeBSD based computing cluster
   to support engineering applications. These applications come in all
   shapes, sizes, and qualities of implementation. To support them and
   our diverse userbase we have been searching for ways to isolate jobs
   from one another in ways that are more effective than Unix time
   sharing and more fine grained than allocating whole nodes to jobs. In
   this talk we discuss the problem space and our efforts so far. These
   efforts include implementation of partial file systems virtualization
   and CPU isolation using CPU sets.

   Multiple Passes of the FreeBSD Device Tree The existing device driver
   framework in FreeBSD works fairly well for many tasks. However, there
   are a few problems that are not easily solved with the current
   design. These problems include having "real" device drivers for
   low-level hardware such as clocks and interrupt controllers, proper
   resource discovery and management, and allowing most drivers to
   always probe and attach in an environment where interrupts are
   enabled. I propose extending the device driver framework to support
   multiple passes over the device tree during boot. This would allow
   certain classes of drivers to be attached earlier and perform
   boot-time setup before other drivers are probed and attached. This in
   turn can be used to develop solutions to the earlier list of
   problems.

   scrypt: A new key derivation function Doing our best to thwart TLAs
   armed with ASICs Password-based key derivation functions are used for
   two primary purposes: First, to hash passwords so that an attacker
   who gains access to a password file does not immediately possess the
   passwords contained therewithin; and second, to generate
   cryptographic keys to be used for encrypting or authenticating data.
   In both cases, if passwords do not have sufficient entropy, an
   attacker with the relevant data can perform a brute force attack,
   hashing potential passwords repeatedly until the correct key is
   found. While commonly used key derivation functions, such as Kamp's
   iterated MD5, Provos and Mazieres' bcrypt, and RSA Laboratories'
   PBKDF1 and PBKDF2 make an attempt to increase the difficulty of
   brute-force attacks, they all require very little memory, making them
   ideally suited to attack by custom hardware. In this talk, I will
   introduce the concepts of memory-hard and sequential memory-hard
   functions, and argue that key derivation functions should be
   sequential memory-hard. I will present a key derivation function
   which, subject to common assumptions about cryptographic hash
   functions, is provably sequential memory-hard, and a variation which
   appears to be stronger (but not provably so). Finally, I will provide
   some estimates of the cost of performing brute force attacks on a
   variety of password strengths and key derivation functions.

   Thinking about thinking in code Proposed keynote talk This is not a
   talk that's specific to any BSD but is a more general talk about how
   we think about coding and how our thinking changes the way we code. I
   compare how we built systems to how other industries build their
   products and talk about what we can learn from how we work and from
   how others work as well.

   Tracking FreeBSD in a commercial Environment How to stay current
   while staying sane The FreeBSD project publishes two lines of source
   code: current and stable. All changes must first be committed to
   current and then are merged into stable. Commercial organizations
   wishing to use FreeBSD in their products must be aware of this
   policy. Four different strategies have developed for tracking FreeBSD
   over time. A company can choose to run only unmodified release
   versions of FreeBSD. A company may choose to import FreeBSD's sources
   once and then never merge newer versions. A company can choose to
   import each new stable branch as it is created, adding its own
   changes to that branch, as well as integrating new versions from
   FreeBSD from time to time. A company can track FreeBSD's current
   branch, adding to it their changes as well as newer FreeBSD changes.
   Which method a company chooses depends on the needs of the company.
   These methods are explored in detail, and their advantages and
   disadvantages are discussed. Tracking FreeBSD's ports and packages is
   not discussed. Companies building products based upon FreeBSD have
   many choices in how to use the projects sources and binaries. The
   choices range from using unmodified binaries from FreeBSD's releases,
   to tracking modify FreeBSD heavily and tracking FreeBSD's evolution
   in a merged tree. Some companies may only need to maintain a stable
   version of FreeBSD with more bug fixes or customizations than the
   FreeBSD project wishes to place in that branch. Some companies also
   wish to contribute some subset of their changes back to the FreeBSD
   project. FreeBSD provides an excellent base technology with which to
   base products. It is a proven leader in performance, reliability and
   scalability. The technology also offers a very business friendly
   license that allows companies to pick and choose which changes they
   wish to contribute to the community rather than forcing all changes
   to be contributed back, or attaching other undesirable license
   conditions to the code. However, the FreeBSD project does not focus
   on integration of its technology into customized commercial products.
   Instead, the project focuses on producing a good, reliable, fast and
   scalable operating system and associated packages. The project
   maintains two lines of development. A current branch, where the main
   development of the project takes place, and a stable branch which is
   managed for stability and reliability. While the project maintains
   documentation on the system, including its development model,
   relatively little guidance has been given to companies in how to
   integrate FreeBSD into their products with a minimum of trouble.
   Developing a sensible strategy to deal with both these portions of
   FreeBSD requires careful planning and analysis. FreeBSD's lack of
   guidelines to companies leaves it up to them to develop a strategy.
   FreeBSD's development model differs from some of the other Free and
   Open Source projects. People familiar with those systems often
   discover that methods that were well suited to them may not work as
   well with FreeBSD's development model. These two issues cause many
   companies to make poor decisions without understanding the problems
   that lie in their future. Very little formal guidance exists for
   companies wishing to integrate FreeBSD into their products. Some
   email threads can be located via a Google search that could help
   companies, but many of them are full of contradictory information,
   and it is very disorganized. While the information about the FreeBSD
   development process is in the FreeBSD handbook, the implications of
   that process for companies integrating FreeBSD into their products
   are not discussed.

   PC-BSD - Making FreeBSD on the desktop a reality FreeBSD on the
   Desktop While FreeBSD is a all-around great operating system, it is
   greatly lagging behind in desktop appeal. Why is this? In this talk,
   we will take a look at some of the desktop drawbacks of FreeBSD, and
   how are are attempting to fix them through PC-BSD. FreeBSD has a
   reputation for its rock-solid reliability, and top-notch performance
   in the server world, but is noticeably absent when it comes to the
   vast market of desktop computing. Why is this? FreeBSD offers many,
   if not almost all of the same open-source packages and software that
   can be found in the more popular Linux desktop distributions, yet
   even with the speed and reliability FreeBSD offers, a relative few
   number of users are deploying it on their desktops. In this
   presentation we will take a look at some of the reasons why FreeBSD
   has not been as widely adopted in the desktop market as it has on the
   server side. Several of the desktop weaknesses of FreeBSD will be
   shown, along with how we are trying to fix these short-comings
   through a desktop-centric version of FreeBSD, known as PC-BSD. We
   will also take a look at the package management system employed by
   all open-source operating systems alike, and some of the pitfalls it
   brings, which may hinder widespread desktop adoption.

   Implementation of TARGET\_MODE applications How we used TARGET\_MODE
   in the kernel to create and interesting product This presentation
   will cover a real world implementation of the TARGET\_MODE
   infrastructure in the kernel (stable/6). Topics to include: drivers
   used (isp, aic7xxx, firewire). scsi\_target userland code vs kernel
   drivers missing drivers (4/8G isp support, iSCSI target) Target Mode
   describes a feature within certain drivers that allows a FreeBSD
   system to emulate a Target in the SCSI sense of the word. By
   recompiling your kernel with this feature enabled, it permits one to
   turn a FreeBSD system into an external hard disk. This feature of the
   FreeBSD kernel provides many interesting implementations and is
   highly desirable to many organizations whom run FreeBSD as their
   platform. I have been tasked with the maintenance of a proprietary
   target driver that interfaces with the FreeBSD kernel to do offsite
   data mirroring at the block level. This talk will discuss the
   implementation of that kernel mode driver and the process my employer
   went through to implement a robust and flexible appliance. Since I
   took over the implementation, we have implemented U160 SCSI(via
   aic7xxx), 2G Fibre Channel(via isp) and Firewire 400 (via sbp\_targ).
   Each driver has it's own subtleties and requirements. I personally
   enhanced the existing Firewire target driver and was able to get some
   interesting results. I hope to demonstrate a functional Firewire
   400/800 target and show how useful this application can be for the
   embedded space. Also, I wish to demonstrate the need for iSCSI. USB
   and 4/8G Fibre Channel target implementations that use the
   TARGET\_MODE infrastructure that is currently in place to allow
   others to expand their various interface types. The presentation
   should consist of a high level overview, followed by detailed
   implementation instructions with regards to the Firewire
   implementation and finish up with a hands-on demonstration with a
   FreeBSD PC flipped into TARGET\_MODE and a Mac.

   Understanding and Tuning SCHED\_ULE With the advent of widespread SMP
   and multicore CPU architectures it was necessary to implement a new
   scheduler in the FreeBSD operating system. The SCHEDULE scheduler was
   added for the 5 series of FreeBSD releases and has now matured to the
   point where it is the default scheduler in the 7.1 release. While
   scheduling processes was a difficult enough task in the uniprocessor
   world, moving to multiple processors, and multiple cores, has
   significantly increased the number of problems that await engineers
   who wish to squeeze every last ounce of performance out of their
   system. This talk will cover the basic design of SCHEDULE and focus a
   great deal of attention on how to tune the scheduler for different
   workloads, using the sysctl interfaces that have been provided for
   that purpose. Understanding and tuning a scheduler used to be done
   only by operating systems designers and perhaps a small minority of
   engineers focusing on esoteric high performance systems. With the
   advent of widespread multi-processor and multi-core architectures it
   has become necessary for more users and administrators to decide how
   to tune their systems for the best performance. The SCHEDULE
   scheduler in FreeBSD provides a set of sysctl interfaces for tuning
   the scheduler at run time, but in order to use these interfaces
   effectively the scheduling process must first be understood. This
   presentation will give an overview of how SCHEDULE works and then
   will show several examples of tuning the system with the interfaces
   provided. The goal of modifying the scheduler's parameters is to
   change the overall performance of programs on the system. One of the
   first problems presented to the person who wants to tune the
   scheduler is how to measure the effects of their changes. Simply
   tweaking the parameters and hoping that that will help is not going
   to lead to good results. In our recent experiments we have used the
   top(1) program to measure our results.

   Improving the FreeBSD TCP Implementation. An update on all things TCP
   in FreeBSD and how they affect you. My involvement in improving the
   FreeBSD TCP stack has continued this past year, with much of the work
   targeted at FreeBSD 8. This talk will cover what these changes
   entail, why they are of interest to the FreeBSD community and how
   they help to improve our TCP implementation. It has been a busy year
   since attending my inaugural BSDCan in 2008, where I talked about
   some of my work with TCP in FreeBSD. I have continued the work on TCP
   analysis/debugging tools and integrating modular congestion control
   into FreeBSD as part of the NewTCP research project. I will provide a
   progress update on this work. Additionally, a grant win from the
   FreeBSD Foundation to undertake a project titled "Improving the
   FreeBSD TCP Implementation" at Swinburne University's Centre for
   Advanced Internet Architectures has been progressing well. The
   project focuses on bringing TCP Appropriate Byte Counting (RFC 3465),
   reassembly queue auto-tuning and integration of low-level
   analysis/debugging tools to the base system, all of which I will also
   discuss.

   Journaling FFS with WAPBL NetBSD 5 is the first NetBSD release with a
   journaling filesystem. This lecture introduces the structure of the
   Fast File System, the modifications for WAPBL and specific
   constraints of the implementation. The Fast File System (FFS) has
   been used in the BSD land for more than two decades. The original
   implementation offered two operational modes: safe and slow (sync)
   unsafe and fast (async) One decade ago, Kirk McKusick introduced the
   soft dependency mechanism to offset the performance impact without
   risk of mortal peril on the first crash. With the advent of Terabyte
   hard disks, the need for a file system check (fsck) after a crash
   becomes finally unacceptable. Even a background fsck like supported
   on FreeBSD consumes lots of CPU time and IO bandwidth. Based on a
   donation from Wasabi Systems, Write Ahead Physical Block Logging
   (WAPBL) provides journaling for FFS with similar or better
   performance than soft dependencies during normal operation. Recovery
   time after crashes depends on the amount of outstanding IO operations
   and normally takes a few seconds. This lecture gives a short overview
   of FFS and the consistency constraints for meta data updates. It
   introduces the WAPBL changes, both in terms of the on-disk format and
   the implementation in NetBSD. Finally the implementation is compared
   to the design of comparable file systems and specific issues of and
   plans for the current implementation are discussed.

   Remote and mass management of systems with finstall Automated
   management on a largish scale An important part of the "finstall"
   project, created as a graphical installer for FreeBSD, is a
   configuration server that can be used to remotely administer and
   configure arbitrary systems. It allows for remote scripting of
   administration tasks and is flexible enough to support complete
   reconfiguration of running systems. The finstall project has two
   major parts - the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is just a
   GUI allowing the users to install the system in a convenient way. The
   back-end is a network-enabled XML-RPC server that is used by the
   front-end to perform its tasks. It can be used as a stand-alone
   configuration daemon. This talk will describe a way to make use of
   this property of finstall to remotely manage large groups of systems.

   whether a certain change between version X and Y of a TCP stack is
   good or bad will be left to human eyes. The initial version of
   tcpdiff presented at NYCBSDCon 2008 demonstrated that it could be
   used to detect at least two major TCP bugs that were introduced into
   FreeBSD in the past few years. The work from that presentation can be
   viewed at http://www.silby.com/nycbsdcon08/. For BSDCan 2009, I hope
   to fix a number of bugs in tcpdiff, make it easier to use, set up
   nightly tests of FreeBSD, and improve it so that additional known
   bugs can be detected. Additionally, I plan to run it on OSes other
   than FreeBSD.

   Crypto Acceleration on FreeBSD As more and more services on the
   internet become cryptographically secured, the load of cryptography
   on systems becomes heavier and heavier. Crypto acceleration hardware
   is available in different forms for different workloads. Embedded
   communications processors from VIA and AMD have limited acceleration
   facilities in silicon and various manufacturers build hardware for
   accelerating secure web traffic and IPSEC VPN tunnels. This talk
   gives an overview of FreeBSD's crypto framework in the kernel and how
   it can be used together with OpenSSL to leverage acceleration
   hardware. Some numbers will be presented to demonstrate how
   acceleration can improve performance - and how it can curiously bring
   a system to a grinding halt. Philip originally started playing with
   crypto acceleration when he saw the "crypto block" in one of his
   Soekris boards. As usual, addiction was instant and by the grace of
   the "you touch it, you own it" principle, he has been fiddling the
   crypto framework more than is good for him.

   Firewire BoF Plugfest Debugging and testing of Firewire products with
   FreeBSD Come one come all to a Firewire plugfest. Let's debug and
   test together and see if we can't knock out some features and bugs. A
   hands-on testing and debugging session of the Firewire stack in
   FreeBSD. Everyone who wishes to attend should bring their Firewire
   devices, ext Drives and Cameras, and their Laptops. I will be
   debugging and capturing data points to enhance and improve features
   in the Firewire stack. We should be able to knock out quite a bunch
   of bugs if folks can bring their various Firewire devices along with
   their various PCs. Even if your Firewire device works perfectly,
   bring it by so it can be documented as supported by the Firewire
   team!

   Building the Network You Need with PF, the OpenBSD packet filter.
   Building the network you need is the central theme for any network
   admin. This tutorial is for aspiring or seasoned network
   professionals with at least a basic knowledge of networking in
   general and TCP/IP particular. The session aims at teaching tools and
   techniques to make sure you build your network to work the way it's
   supposed to, keeping you in charge. Central to the toolbox is the
   OpenBSD PF packet filter, supplemented with tools that interact with
   it. Whether you are a greybeard looking for ways to optimize your
   setups or a greenhorn just starting out, this session will give you
   valuable insight into the inner life of your network and provide
   pointers to how to use that knowledge to build the network you need.
   The session will also offer some fresh information on changes
   introduced in OpenBSD 4.5, the most recent version of PF and OpenBSD.
   The tutorial is loosely based on Hansteen's recent book, /The Book of
   PF/ (No Starch Press), with updates and adaptations based on
   developments since the book's publication date.

   Networking from the Bottom Up: Device Drivers. In this tutorial I
   will describe how to write and maintain network drivers in FreeBSD
   and use the example of the Intel Gigabit Ethernet driver (igb)
   throughout the course. Students will learn the basic data structures
   and APIs necessary to implement a network driver in FreeBSD. The
   tutorial is general enough that it can be applied to other BSDs, and
   likely to other embedded and UNIX like systems while being specific
   enough that given a device and a manual the student should be able to
   develop a working driver on their own. This is the first of a series
   of lectures on network that I am developing over the next year or so.

   pfSense Tutorial From Zero to Hero with pfSense pfSense is a free,
   open source customized distribution of FreeBSD tailored for use as a
   firewall and router. In addition to being a powerful, flexible
   firewalling and routing platform, it includes a long list of related
   features and a package system allowing further expandability without
   adding bloat and potential security vulnerabilities to the base
   distribution. pfSense is a popular project with more than 1 million
   downloads since its inception, and proven in countless installations
   ranging from small home networks protecting a PC and an Xbox to large
   corporations, universities and other organizations protecting
   thousands of network devices. This tutorial is being presented by the
   founders of the pfSense project, Chris Buechler and Scott Ullrich.
   The session will start with an introduction to the project, hardware
   sizing and selection, installation, firewalling concepts and basic
   configuration, and continue to cover all the most popular features of
   the system. Common usage scenarios, deployment considerations, step
   by step configuration guidance, and best practices will be covered
   for each feature. Most configurations will be demonstrated in a live
   lab environment. Attendees are assumed to have basic knowledge of
   TCP/IP and firewalling concepts, however no in-depth knowledge in
   these areas or prior knowledge of pfSense or FreeBSD is necessary.

   FreeBSD/mips Embedding FreeBSD FreeBSD now runs on the MIPS platform.
   FreeBSD/mips supports MIPS-32 and MIPS-64 targets, including SMP for
   multicore support. FreeBSD/mips is targeted at the embedded MIPS
   marketplace. FreeBSD has run on the MIPS platform for many years.
   Juniper ported FreeBSD to the Mips platform in the late 1990's.
   However, concern about intellectual property issues kept Juniper from
   contributing the port back to FreeBSD until recently. The contributed
   port was a 64-bit mips port. In the mean time, many efforts were made
   to bring FreeBSD to the mips platform. The first substantial effort
   to bring FreeBSD to the Mips platform was done by Juli Mallet. This
   effort made it to single user, but never further than that. This
   effort was abandoned due to a change in Juli's life. The port
   languished. Two years ago at BSDcan, as my involvement with
   FreeBSD/arm was growing, I tried to rally the troops into doing a
   FreeBSD/mips port. My efforts resulted in what has been commonly
   called the "mips2" effort. The name comes from the choice of
   //depot/projects/mips2 to host the work in perforce. A number of
   people worked on the earliest versions of the port, but it too
   languished and seemed destined to suffer the same fate as earlier
   efforts. Then, two individuals stood up and started working on the
   port. Wojciech A. Koszek and Oleksandr Tymoshenko pulled in code from
   the prior efforts. Through their efforts of stabilizing this code,
   the port to the single user stage and ported it to three different
   platforms. Others ported it to a few more. Snapshots of this work
   were released from time to time. Cavium Networks picked up one of
   these snapshots and ported it to their multicore mips64 network
   processor. Cavium has kindly donated much of their work to the
   comminuty. In December, I started at Cisco systems. My first job was
   to merge all the divergent variants of FreeBSD/mips and get it into
   shape to push into the tree. With luck, this should be in the tree
   before I give my talk. In parallel to this, other advances in the
   embedded support for FreeBSD have been happening as well. I'll talk
   about new device drivers, new subsystems, and new build tools that
   help to support the embedded developer.

   Building self-contained PBIs from Ports (Automagically) Creating a
   self-contained application from the ports tree PC-BSD provides a
   user-friendly desktop experience, for experts and casual users alike.
   PC-BSD is 100% FreeBSD under the hood, while providing desktop
   essentials, such as a graphical installation system, point-n-click
   package-management using the PBI system, and easy to use system
   management tools; All integrated into an easy to use K Desktop
   Environment (KDE). The PBI (Push Button Installer) format is the
   cornerstone of the PC-BSD desktop, which allows users to install
   applications in a self-contained format, free from dependency
   problems, and compile issues that stop most casual users from desktop
   adoption. The PBI format also provides power and flexibility in user
   interaction, and scripting support, which allows applications to be
   fine-tuned to the best possible user experience. This talk would go
   over in some detail our new PBI building system, which converts a
   FreeBSD port, such as FireFox, into a standalone self-contained PBI
   installer for PC-BSD desktops. The presentation will be divided into
   two main sections: The Push Button Installer (PBI) Format The basics
   of the PBI format The PBI format construction Add & Remove scripting

   An Open Source Enterprise VPN Solution with OpenVPN and OpenBSD
   Solving the problem At Appalachian State University, we utilize an
   open source VPN to allow faculty, staff and vendors secure access to
   Appalachian State University's internal network from any location
   that has an Internet connection. To implement our virtual private
   network project, we needed a secure VPN that is flexible enough to
   work with our existing network registration and LDAP authentication
   systems, has simple client installation, is redundant, allows
   multiple VPN server instances for special site-to-site tunnels and
   unique configurations, and can run on multiple platforms. Using
   OpenVPN running on OpenBSD, we met those requirements and added a
   distributed administration system that allows select users to allow
   VPN access to specific computers for external users and vendors
   without requiring intervention from our network or security
   personnel. Our presentation will start with a quick overview of
   OpenVPN and OpenBSD and then detail the specifics of our VPN
   implementation. Dissatisfied with IPSec for road warrior VPN usage we
   went looking for a better solution. We had hopped that we could find
   a solution that would run on multiple platforms, was flexible and
   worked well. We found OpenVPN and have been pleased. Initially we ran
   it on RHEL. We migrated to OpenBSD for pf functionality and general
   security concerns. ...and because we like OpenBSD. Our presentation
   will focus on the specifics of our VPN implementation. We will
   quickly cover the basics of OpenVPN and the most used features of
   OpenBSD. Moving along we will cover multiple authentication methods,
   redundancy, running multiple instances, integration with our netreg
   system, how pf has extended functionality, embedding in appliances,
   and client configuration. The system has proven helpful with
   providing vendor access where needed and we'll cover this aspect as
   well. Time permitting we will cover current enhancement efforts and
   future plans. OpenVPN has been called the "Swiss army knife" of VPN
   solutions. We hope our presentation leaves participants with that
   feeling.

   "finstall" - the new FreeBSD installer A graphical installer for
   FreeBSD The "finstall" project, sponsored by Google as a Summer of
   Code 2007 project, is an attempt to create a user-friendly graphical
   installer for FreeBSD, with enough strong technical features to
   appeal to the more professional users. A long term goal for it is to
   be a replacement for sysinstall, and as such should support almost
   all of the features present in sysinstall, as well as add support for
   new FreeBSD features such as GEOM, ZFS, etc. This talk will describe
   the architecture of "finstall" and focus on its lesser known features
   such as remote installation. "finstall" is funded by Google SoC as a
   possible long-term replacement for sysinstall, as a "LiveCD" with the
   whole FreeBSD base system on the CD, with X11 and XFCE4 GUI. In the
   talk I intend to describe what I did so far, and what are the future
   plans for it. This includes the installer GUI, the backend (which has
   the potential to become a generic FreeBSD configuration backend) and
   the assorted tools developed for finstall ("LiveCD" creation
   scripts). More information on finstall can be found here:
   http://wiki.freebsd.org/finstall.

   Measured (almost) does Air Traffic Control Monitoring weird hardware
   reliably The new Danish Air Traffic Control system, CASIMO, prompted
   the development on a modular and general software platform for data
   collection, control and monitoring of "weird hardware" of all sorts.
   The talk will present the "measured" daemon, and detail some of the
   uses it has been put to, as an, admittedly peripheral, component of
   the ATC system. Many "SCADA" systems suffer from lack of usable
   interfaces for external access to the data. Measured takes the
   opposite point of view and makes real-time situation available, and
   accepts control instructions as ASCII text stream over TCP
   connections. Several examples of how this can be used will be
   demonstrated. Measured will run on any FreeBSD system, but has not
   been ported to other UNIX variants yet, and it is perfect for that
   "intelligent house" project of yours. I believe I gave a WIP
   presentation of this about two years ago.

   BSD licensed C++ compiler LLVM is a suite of carefully designed open
   source libraries that implement compiler components (like language
   front-ends, code generators, aggressive optimizers, Just-In-Time
   compiler support, debug support, link-time optimization, etc.). The
   goal of the LLVM project is to build these components in a way that
   allows them to be combined together to create familiar tools (like a
   C compiler), interesting new tools (like an OpenGL JIT compiler), and
   many other things we haven't thought of yet. Because LLVM is under
   continuous development, clients of these components naturally benefit
   from improvements in the libraries. This talk gives an overview of
   LLVM's design and approach to compiler construction, and gives
   several example applications. It describes applications of LLVM
   technology to llvm-gcc (a C/C++/Objective C compiler based on the GNU
   GCC front-end), the OpenGL stack in Mac OS/X Leopard, and Clang.
   Among other things, the Clang+LLVM Compiler provides a fully
   BSD-Licensed C and Objective-C compiler (with C++ in development)
   which compiles code several times faster than GCC, produces code that
   is faster than GCC in many cases, produces better warnings and error
   messages, and supports many other applications (e.g. static analysis
   and refactoring).

   Google SoC Summer of Code In this talk, I will briefly discuss some
   general ways Google's Open Source Team contributes to the wider
   community. The rest of the talk will explore some highlights of the
   Google Summer of Code program, our initiative to get university
   students involved in Open Source development. I will cover the
   program's inception, lessons learned over time and tips for success
   in the program for both mentors and students. In particular, the talk
   will detail some experiences of the \*BSD mentoring organizations
   involved in the program as a case study in successfully managing the
   program from the Open Source project's perspective. Any Google Summer
   of Code participants in the audience are welcome and encouraged to
   chime in with their own insights.

   A closer look at the ZFS file system simple administration,
   transactional semantics, end-to-end data integrity SUN's ZFS file
   system became part of FreeBSD on 6th April 2007. ZFS is a new kind of
   file system that provides simple administration, transactional
   semantics, end-to-end data integrity, and immense scalability. ZFS is
   not an incremental improvement to existing technology; it is a
   fundamentally new approach to data management. We've blown away 20
   years of obsolete assumptions, eliminated complexity at the source,
   and created a storage system that's actually a pleasure to use. ZFS
   presents a pooled storage model that completely eliminates the
   concept of volumes and the associated problems of partitions,
   provisioning, wasted bandwidth and stranded storage. Thousands of
   file systems can draw from a common storage pool, each one consuming
   only as much space as it actually needs. The combined I/O bandwidth
   of all devices in the pool is available to all filesystems at all
   times. All operations are copy-on-write transactions, so the on-disk
   state is always valid. There is no need to fsck(1M) a ZFS file
   system, ever. Every block is checksummed to prevent silent data
   corruption, and the data is self-healing in replicated (mirrored or
   RAID) configurations. If one copy is damaged, ZFS detects it and uses
   another copy to repair it.

   Interfacing embedded FreeBSD with U-Boot Working with the de facto
   standard for an initial level boot loader In the embedded world
   U-Boot is a de facto standard for an initial level boot loader
   (firmware). It runs on a great number of platforms and architectures,
   and is open source. This talk covers the development work on
   integrating FreeBSD with U-Boot-based systems. Starting with an
   overview of differences between booting an all-purpose desktop
   computer vs. embedded system, FreeBSD booting concepts are explained
   along with requirements for the underlying firmware. Historical
   attempts to interface FreeBSD with this firmware are mentioned and
   explanation given on why they failed or proved incomplete. Finally,
   the recently developed approach to integrate FreeBSD and U-Boot is
   presented, with implementation details and particular attention on
   how it's been made architecture and platform independent, and how
   loader(8) has been bound to it.

   Introduction to Debugging the FreeBSD Kernel Just like every other
   piece of software, the FreeBSD kernel has bugs. Debugging a kernel is
   a bit different from debugging a userland program as there is nothing
   underneath the kernel to provide debugging facilities such as
   ptrace() or procfs. This paper will give a brief overview of some of
   the tools available for investigating bugs in the FreeBSD kernel. It
   will cover the in-kernel debugger DDB and the external debugger kgdb
   which is used to perform post-mortem analysis on kernel crash dumps.
   Introduction to Debugging the FreeBSD Kernel Basic crash messages,
   what a crash looks like typical panic() invocation page fault example
   "live" debugging with DDB stack traces ps deadlock examples show
   lockchain show sleepchain Adding new DDB commands KGDB inspecting
   processes and threads working with kernel modules using scripts to
   extend examining crashdumps using utilities ps, netstat, etc.

   DTrace for FreeBSD What on earth is that system doing?! DTrace is a
   comprehensive dynamic tracing facility originally developed for
   Solaris that can be used by administrators and developers on live
   production systems to examine the behavior of both user programs and
   of the operating system itself. DTrace enables users to explore their
   system to understand how it works, track down performance problems
   across many layers of software, or locate the cause of aberrant
   behavior. DTrace lets users create their own custom programs to
   dynamically instrument the system and provide immediate, concise
   answers to arbitrary questions you can formulate using the DTrace D
   programming language. This talk discusses the port of the DTrace
   facility to FreeBSD and demonstrates examples on a live FreeBSD
   system. Introduction to the D language - probes, predicates and
   actions. dtrace(8) and libdtrace - the userland side of the DTrace
   story. The DTrace kernel module, it's ioctl interface to userland and
   the provider infrastructure in the kernel. DTrace kernel hooks and
   the problem of code licensed under Sun's CDDL. What does a DTrace
   probe actually do? DTrace safety and how it is implemented. Build
   system changes to add CTF (Compact C Type Format) data to objects,
   shared libraries and executables. The DTrace test suite. A brief list
   of things to do to port the DTrace facility to other BSD-derived
   operating systems.

   What Not To Do When Writing Network Applications The lessons learnt
   working with not-so-high-performance network applications This talk
   will look at issues which face the modern network application
   developer, from the point of view of poorly-designed examples. This
   will cover internal code structure and dataflow, interaction with the
   TCP stack, IO scheduling in high and low latency environments and
   high-availability considerations. In essence, this presentation
   should be seen as a checklist of what not to do when writing network
   applications. Plenty of examples of well designed network
   applications exist in the open and closed source world today.
   Unfortunately there are just as many examples of fast network
   applications as there are "fast but workload specific"; sometimes
   failing miserably in handling the general case. This may be due to
   explicit design (eg Varnish) but many are simply due to the designer
   not fully appreciating the wide variance in "networks" - and their
   network application degrades ungracefully when under duress. My aim
   in this presentation is to touch on a wide number of issues which
   face network application programmers - most of which seem not
   "application related" to the newcomer - such as including pipelining
   into network communication, managing a balance between accepting new
   requests and servicing existing requests, or providing back-pressure
   to a L4 loadbalancer in case of traffic bursts. Various schemes for
   working with these issues will be presented, and hopefully
   participants will walk away with more of an understanding about how
   the network, application and operating systems interact.

   Using FreeBSD to Promote Open Source Development Methods In this talk
   we present Aerosource, an initiative to bring Open Source Software
   development methods to internal software developers at The Aerospace
   Corporation. Within Aerosource, FreeBSD is used in several key roles.
   First, we run most of our tools on top of FreeBSD. Second, the ports
   collection (both official ports and custom internal ones) eases our
   administrative burden. Third, the FreeBSD project serves as an
   example and role model for the results that can be achieved by an
   Open Source Software projects. We discuss the development
   infrastructure we have built for Aerosource based largely on BSD
   licensed software including FreeBSD, PostgreSQL, Apache, and Trac. We
   will also discuss our custom management tools including our system
   for managing our custom internal ports. Finally, we will cover our
   development successes and how we use projects like FreeBSD as
   exemplars of OSS development.

   Porting FreeBSD/ARM to Marvell Orion System-On-Chip This talk covers
   the development work on porting the FreeBSD/ARM to Marvell Orion
   family of highly integrated chips. ARM architecture is widely adopted
   in the embedded devices, and since the architecture can be licensed,
   many implementation variations exist: Orion is a derivative compliant
   with the ARMv5TE definition, it provides a rich set of on-chip
   peripherals. Present state of the FreeBSD support for ARM is
   explained, areas for improvement highlighted and its overall shape
   and condition presented. The main discussion covers scope of the
   Orion port (what integrated peripherals required new development,
   what was adapted from existing code base); design decisions are
   explained for the most critical items, and implementation details
   revealed. Summary notes are given on general porting methodology,
   debugging techniques and difficulties encountered during such
   undertaking.

   Our Topic: Network Protocol Development Tools and Techniques for
   FreeBSD Our Speaker: George Neville-Neil, co-author of the "Design
   and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System" "daemon" book.
   Our Topic: While computers have gotten faster and more powerful the
   tools we use to develop network protocols, such as TCP, UDP, IPv4 and
   IPv6 have not. Most network protocols are developed, in C, in the
   kernel, and require a lot of work to test. Over the past year or so I
   have been working with virtual machines, a couple of pieces of open
   source software, and begun developing a library for use in protocol
   testing. This talk will cover three topics: Developing and testing
   kernel code with Virtual Machines Finding good tests for networking
   code Packet Construction Set (PCS) a new library for writing protocol
   tests

   The FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, Solaris, and Windows operating systems have
   kernels that provide comparable facilities. Interestingly, their code
   bases share almost no common parts, while their development processes
   vary dramatically. We analyze the source code of the four systems by
   collecting metrics in the areas of file organization, code structure,
   code style, the use of the C preprocessor, and data organization. The
   aggregate results indicate that across various areas and many
   different metrics, four systems developed using wildly different
   processes score comparably. This allows us to posit that the
   structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial
   software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering
   requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being
   marginal, if any.

   FreeBSD is a sophisticated operating system developed and maintained
   as open-source software by a team of more than 350 individuals
   located throughout the world. This study uses developer location
   data, the configuration management repository, and records from the
   issue database to examine the extent of global development and its
   effect on productivity, quality, and developer cooperation. The key
   findings are that global development allows round-the-clock work, but
   there are some marked differences between the type of work performed
   at different regions. The effects of multiple dispersed developers on
   the quality of code and productivity are negligible. Mentoring
   appears to be sometimes associated with developers living closer
   together, but ad-hoc cooperation seems to work fine across
   continents.

   This paper provides a how-to embed FreeBSD. A console server built
   form an AT91RM9200 based ARM system will be explored. This paper will
   talk about the selection of hardware. It will explore creating images
   for the target system, as well as concentrate on different
   alternatives for deploying the system. A number of different options
   exist today, and no comprehensive guide for navigating through the
   choices exists today. This paper will explore the different
   alternatives that exist today for producing images targeted at
   different size requirements. The differing choices for storage in an
   embedded environment are explored. The techniques used to access rich
   debugging environments are discussed.

   In the past ten years most of the research in network protocols has
   gone into TCP, leaving UDP to languish as a local configuration
   protocol. While the majority of Internet traffic is TCP, UDP remains
   the only IP protocol that works over multicast and as such has some
   specific, and interesting uses in some areas of computing. In 2008 we
   undertook a study of the performance of UDP multicast on both 1Gbps
   and 10Gbps Ethernet networks in order to see if changing the physical
   layer of the network would give a linear decrease in packet latency.
   To measure the possible gains we developed a new network protocol
   test program, mctest, which is capable of recording packet round trip
   times from many hosts simultaneously and which we believe accurately
   represents how many environments use multicast. The mctest program
   has been integrated into FreeBSD and is now being used to verify the
   proper operation of multicast on various pieces of 10Gbps hardware.

   In recent years, traditional branches of engineering like Civil,
   Chemical, Mechanical, Electrical and Industrial Engineering are
   requiring extensive computing facilities for their needs. Several
   well known labs (Sandia, Lawrence Livermore) rely on huge clusters to
   do all types of complex analysis that were unthinkable a couple of
   decades ago. While the free BSD variants share the environment with
   traditional UNIX systems, frequently used for such computations, it
   was not common to find adequate free software packages to carry
   complex calculations. Eventually commercial versions of important
   math related packages started to appear for the Linux platform. Even
   when the big packages were distant, the BSDs learned and adapted in
   resourceful ways: Matlab and Mathematica, running under Linux
   emulation, demanded functionality from the BSDs and NetBSD
   implemented a signal trampoline to be able to run AutoCAD with IRIX
   binary compatibility. A notable project that was always available
   under a free license was Berkeley's Spice circuit analysis program,
   however it was an exception rather than the rule. Even when the
   scientific community pressed for a while to get other important tools
   like NASA's FEA package Nastran under a free license, the objective
   of being able to access and enhance open scientific tools was
   elusive. About a decade ago the situation started to improve:
   FreeBSD's ports system started growing exponentially, first with a
   high content in the math category, afterwards with a CAD section and
   after sustained growth in those categories a science section was
   created. This growth was mostly pushed by Universities and their
   research projects and in general are not well known with respect to
   the commercial counterparts. I started porting math/engineering code
   for FreeBSD around 1996. Back then it was absolutely unthinkable for
   a Mechanical Engineer to depend only on FreeBSD for it's daily work.
   The situation nowadays is different: there are some very high quality
   engineering analysis packages like EDF's Code Aster, with more than
   12 years of professional development, that just can't be ignored. A
   Finite Element package, like Code Aster, can easily cost 5000 US$, is
   priced according to the maximum problem size it can solve, can
   require yearly licenses, and is rarely available with source code. In
   NASTRAN's case the source code is only available for US citizens
   under a yearly fee. Free software does have serious limitations
   though; just like in office applications there are proprietary CAD
   formats or sometimes the package simply doesn't have the required
   functionality. Having the sources, of course, always has the
   advantage of being able to implement (or pay for) some specific
   functionality you might need. Many commercial packages have been
   recently ported to Linux, but even when they gain some of the
   advantages of an open environment they still have yet another
   limitation: they have been very slow to make use of the multicored
   features of the new processors in the market, a huge limitation now
   that the speed war between processors has been limited by the
   overheating problem. The objective of the talk is to give an overview
   of several CAD/CAE packages that have been made available recently as
   part of FreeBSD's ports system and the decisions that were made to
   port them. BRLCAD and Varkon are two CAD utilities that made a
   transition from closed source to an open environment and in the
   process in the process of getting ported to BSD have gained greater
   portability and general "bug" fixes critical for their consolidation
   as usable and maintainable projects. There are also some tricks that
   have not been well documented: it is possible to enable threads and
   some extra optimizations on some packages, and it is also possible to
   replace the standard BLAS library with the faster GOTO BLAS without
   rebuilding the package. It is also possible to build the packages
   optimized for a clustered environment, but perhaps what is most
   interesting of all is how all the packages interrelate with each
   other and can turn FreeBSD into a complete enginering environment. No
   OS distribution so far is offering all the engineering specific
   utilities offered through FreeBSD's ports system: from design to
   visualization, passing through analysis FreeBSD is becoming an option
   that can't be ignored, and best of all, it is an effort that will
   benefit not only FreeBSD but the wider audience. Pedro F. Giffuni M.

   started when I was about 12 years old With the TRS-80 Color Computer

   the computer world until the Internet came stepping along. I started

   being able to install a complete version of UNIX from the net with
   just one floppy. After submitting a the 999th port to the FreeBSD
   project Walnut Creek was kind enough to give me a subscription for
   several years to FreeBSD's CD-ROM. Since then I've been on and off
   porting software packages or fixing the bugs I have caused while
   porting them. Of course there has always been great respect for the
   other BSDs and their wonderful license and while I've given up on the
   idea of one day seeing a "UnifiedBSD" I am glad to see different
   approaches sharing ideas in a healthful environment. Keywords: BSD,

   In this talk, we will discuss the past and present history and the
   design principles of the OpenBSD hardware sensors framework. Sensors
   framework provides a unified interface for storing, registering and
   accessing information about hardware monitoring sensors. Sensor types
   include, but are not limited to, temperature, voltage, fan RPM, time
   offset and logical drive status. The framework spans
   sensor\_attach(9), sysctl(3), sysctl(8), sensorsd(8), ntpd(8),
   snmpd(8) and more than 67 drivers, ranging from I2C temperature
   sensors and Super I/O hardware monitors to IPMI, RAID and SCSI
   enclosures. Several third-party tools are also available, for
   example, a plug-in for Nagios and ports/sysutils/symon. Originally
   based on some ideas from NetBSD, the framework has sustained many
   improvements in OpenBSD, and was ported and committed to FreeBSD and
   DragonFly BSD. Constantine A. Murenin is an MMath graduate student at
   the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of
   Waterloo (CA). Prior to his graduate appointment, Constantine
   attended and subsequently graduated from East Carolina University
   (US) and De Montfort University (UK), receiving two bachelor degrees
   in computer science, with honors and honours respectively. A FreeBSD
   Google Summer of Code 2007 Student, OpenBSD Committer and Mozilla
   Contributor, Constantine's interests range from standards compliance
   and usability at all levels, to quiet computing and hardware
   monitoring. http://Constantine.SU/

   The first part will explain what have been major changes since Manu's
   presentation at Bale's EuroBSDCon, including more detailed
   informations on changes which have a significant impact on
   administrator's bad habits (why the common way of doing it is bad,
   why it was sometimes needed in the past, how to do it the good way
   now, why this is far better), on both the UserLand (ipsec-tools
   project) and maybe in [Free\|Net]BSD kernels/ IPSec stacks. The
   second part will talk about the future of the project. News of the
   next major version (which may be out or about to be out when we'll be
   ate EuroBSDCon), news works which are planned or which are done but
   not yet public, but also news about the team: it's new members, new
   tools, what we would like to do in tue future, a Yvan VANHULLEBUS

   The arrival of high CPU core density, with commodity quad-core
   notebooks and 32-core servers, combined with 10gbps networking have
   transformed network design principles for operating systems. This
   talk will describe changes in the FreeBSD 6.x, 7.x, and forthcoming
   8.x network stacks required to exploit multiple cores and serve
   10gbps networks. The goal of the session will be to introduce the

   Martin Schuette has three main goals, defined by three internet
   drafts to implement: TLS transport is the most obvious improvement:
   it provides a reliable network transport with data encryption and
   peer authentication. To make full use of this a buffering mechanism
   to bridge temporary network errors is implemented as well.
   Syslog-protocol extends the message format to use a complete
   timestamp, include a fully qualified domain name, and allow UTF-8
   messages. It also offers a structured data field to unambiguously
   encode application dependent information. Syslog-sign will allow any
   syslog sender to digitally sign its messages, so their integrity can
   be verified later. This enable the detection of loss, deletion or
   other manipulation syslog data after network transfer or archiving on
   storage media. Martin Schuette is a student of computer science in
   Potsdam, Germany, and has been working as a part-time system
   administrator for BSD servers since 2004. In 2007 Martin Schuette
   already gave a talk on Syslog at the Chemnitze Linux-Tage
   (http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2007/vortraege/detail.html?idx=547

   Given the modern trend towards multi-core shared memory
   multiprocessors, it is inconceivable for production OS kernels not to
   be reentrant. The typical approach for allowing multiple execution
   contexts to simultaneously execute in kernel mode has been to use
   fine-grained locking for synchronising access to shared resources.
   While this technique has been proven efficient, empirical evidence
   suggests that the resulting locking rules tend to be cumbersome even
   for the experienced kernel programmer, leading to bugs that are hard
   to diagnose. Moreover, scaling to more processors requires extensive
   use of locks, which may impose unnecessary locking overhead for small
   scale multiprocessor systems. This talk will describe the typical
   approach and then discuss the alternative approach taken in the
   DragonFlyBSD network stack. We will give an overview of the various
   protocol threads employed for network I/O processing and the
   common-case code paths for packet reception and transmission.
   Additionally, we'll need to make a passing reference to
   DragonFlyBSD's message passing model. This should establish a
   baseline, allowing us to focus on the recent work by the author to
   eliminate use of the Big Giant Lock in the performance-critical paths
   for the TCP and UDP protocols. The decision to constrain this work on
   the two by far most widely-used transport protocols was made in order
   to (a) limit the amount of work necessary and (b) explore the
   effectiveness of the approach on the cases that matter at this point
   in time.

   Many BSD-licensed strategies of various levels of maturity exist to
   implement multiplicity, herein defined as the introduction of
   plurality to traditionally singular computing environments via
   isolation, virtualization, or other method. For example, the chroot
   utility introduces an additional isolated root execution environment
   within that of the host; or an emulator provides highly-isolated
   virtual systems that can run complete native or foreign operating
   systems. Motivations for multiplicity vary, but a demonstrable desire
   exists for users to obtain root or run a foreign binary or operating
   system. We propose a hands-on survey of portable and integrated
   BSD-licensed multiplicity strategies applicable to the FreeBSD,
   OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD and NetBSD operating systems on the i386
   architecture. We will also address three oft-coupled disciplines:
   software storage devices, the installation of operating system and
   userlands in multiplicity environments plus the management of select
   multiplicity environments. Finally we will comment on each strategies
   potential limits of isolation, compatibility, independence and
   potential overhead in comparison to traditional systems. Keywords:
   multiplicity, virtualization, chroot, jail, hypervisor, xen, compat.
   Michael Dexter has used Unix systems since 1991 and BSD-licensed
   multiplicity strategies for over five years. He is the Program
   Manager at the BSD Fund and Project Manager of the BSD.lv Project.

   Hello My name is Nick Barkas. I'm a master's student studying
   scientific computing at Kungliga Tekniska hgskolan (KTH) in
   Stockholm, Sweden. I have just begun work on a Google Summer of Code
   project with FreeBSD: Dynamic memory allocation for dirhash in UFS2 .
   I would like to present my results from this project at EuroBSDCon
   this year. This project is very much a work in progress now so it is
   a bit difficult to summarize what I would ultimately present. I will
   try to describe an outline, though. First I will give background
   information on dirhash: an explanation of the directory data
   structure in UFS2, how directory lookups in this structure
   necessitate a linear search, and how dirhash speeds these lookups up
   without having to change anything about the directory data structure.
   Next I will explain the current limitation that dirhash's maximum
   memory use must be manually specified by administrators, or left at a
   small conservative default of 2MB. I will explain some different
   methods I will have explored to try and make this maximum memory
   limit dynamically increase and decrease as the system has more or
   less free memory, and which method I will have ultimately settled on
   and implemented. Then I'll present some test results of performance
   of operations on very large directories with and without dynamic
   memory allocation enabled for dirhash. Next I will talk about how
   speed gains from dirhash are limited by the fact that the hash tables
   exist only in memory and must be recreated after each system boot, as
   big directories are scanned for the first time, or even have to be
   recreated for a directory that has not been scanned in some time if
   its dirhash has been discarded to free memory. These problems can be
   eliminated by using an on-disk index for directory entries. I will
   talk about some of the challenges of implementing on-disk indexing,
   such as remaining backwards compatible with older versions of UFS2
   and interoperating properly with softupdates. Then, if my SoC project
   has permitted me time to work on this aspect of it, I will explain
   some possible methods for adding directory indexing to UFS2 that
   meets these challenges, and which of those ideas I will have
   implemented. Finally I will present results of some benchmarks on
   this filesystem with indices, and compare to performance with
   dirhash, and with no indices or dirhashes. Keywords: dirhash, ufs2,
   filesystems, performance tuning

   Traditional project management methodologies are typically based on
   the waterfall model where there are distinct phases: requirements
   capture, design, implementation, testing, delivery. Once a project
   has moved on to the next phase there is no going back. The end result
   is often a late project that no-one wants anymore because the
   requirements have fundamentally changed by the time the project is
   delivered.

   The members of the BSD family have traditionally prospered off the
   desktop, as operating systems on servers and embedded systems. The
   advent of MacOS X has marked a change, and moved the desktop more
   into focus. Modern desktop systems create a richer software
   landscape, with more diverse requirements, than their server
   counterparts. User demands, software package interdependencies and
   frequent security issues result in a change rate that can put a
   considerable load on the admin staff. Without central management
   tools, previously identical installations diverge quickly. This paper
   looks at concepts and strategies for managing tens to hundreds of
   modern, Unix-like desktop clients. The available management tools
   range from simple, image-based software distribution, mainly used for
   setting up uniform clients, to "intelligent" rule-based engines
   capable of search-and-replace operations on configuration files. We
   will briefly compare their properties and limitations, then take a
   closer look at Radmind, a suite for file level administration of Unix
   clients. Radmind has been in use in the Institute of
   Telecommunication at Technische Universitt Darmstadt for over three
   years, managing NetBSD and Debian Linux clients in the labs as well
   as faculty members' machines. We will explore the Radmind suite's
   underlying concepts and functionality. In order to see how the
   concept holds up, we will discuss real-world scenarios from the
   system life-cycle of Installation, configuration changes, security
   updates, component updates, and system upgrades. Hauke Fath works as
   a systems administrator for the Institut fr Nachrichtentechnik
   (telecommunication) at Technische Universitt Darmstadt. He has been
   using NetBSD since 1994, when he first booted a NetBSD 1.0A kernel on
   a Macintosh SE/30. NetBSD helped shaping his career by causing a slow
   drift from application programmer's work towards systems and network
   administration. Hauke Fath holds a MS in Physics and became a NetBSD
   developer in late 2006. Keywords: Managing Unix desktop clients,
   software distribution, tripwire

   This paper discusses the NetBSD Power Management Framework (PMF) and
   related changes to the kernel. The outlined changes allow NetBSD to
   support essential functions like suspend-to-RAM on most post-Y2K X86
   machines. They are also the fundation for intelligent handling of
   device activity by enabling devices on-demand. This work is still
   progressing. Many of the features will be available in the up-coming
   NetBSD 5.0 release The NetBSD kernel is widely regarded to be one of
   the cleanest and most portable Operating System kernels available.
   For various reasons it is also assumed that NetBSD only runs well on
   older hardware. In the summer of 2006 Charles Hannum, one of the
   founders of NetBSD, left with a long mail mentioning as important
   issues the lack of proper power management and suspendto- RAM
   support. One year later, Jared D. McNeill posted a plan for attacking
   this issue based on ideas derived from the Windows Driver Model. This
   plan would evolve into the new NetBSD Power Management Framework (PMF
   for short).

   The Aerospace Corporation operates a federally funded research and
   development center in support of national-security, civil and
   commercial space programs. Many of our 2400+ engineers use a variety
   of computing technologies to support their work. Applications range
   from small models which are easily handled by desktops to parameter
   studies involving thousands of cpu hours and traditional, large scale
   parallel codes such as computational fluid dynamics and molecular
   modeling applications. Our primary resources used to support these
   large applications are computing clusters. Our current primary
   cluster, the Fellowship cluster consists of 352 dual-processor nodes
   with a total of 14xx cores. Two additional clusters, beginning at 150
   dual-processor nodes each are being constructed to augment
   Fellowship. As in In any multiuser computing environment with limited
   resources, user competition for resources is a significant burden.
   Users want everything they need to do their job, right now.
   Unfortunately, other users may need those resources at the same time.
   Thus, systems to arbitrate this resource contention are necessary. On
   Fellowship we have deployed the Sun Grid Engine scheduler which
   scheduled batch jobs across the nodes. In the next section we discuss
   the performance problems that can occur when sharing resources in a
   high performance computing cluster. We then discuss range of
   possibilities to address these problems. We then explain the
   solutions we are investigating and describe our experiments with
   them. We then conclude with a discussion of future work.

   The University of Toronto is a large educational institutional with
   over 70,000 students and 10,000 staff and faculty. For the past three
   years, we have developed and implemented a ubiquitous VPN service,
   based up on OpenVPN and FreeBSD. The service has over 3000 active
   customers, with up to 35 simultaneous users. The system supports,
   Linux, Mac OS X and Windows XP/Vista/2000 clients. Tools have been
   developed to create a central CA which enables users to log in to a
   secure server and get their customized client, certificates and
   configuration. The NSIS installer is used to generate the customized
   windows installers. Similar packages are generated for the various
   Unix based clients. Additional WWW/PHP based tools, have been
   developed to monitor and log usage of the service, using standard
   graphs, alarms for excessive use and a certificate revocation
   mechanism. The system has been integrated into the local identity
   management system (Kerberos/LDAP) in order to authorize and
   authenticate users upon initiation and per session usage. All code is
   Open Source and freely available.

   The Google Summer of Code is a program designed to provide students
   with real world experience contributing to open source projects
   during the summer break in university studies. Each year Google
   selects a number of open source projects to act as mentoring
   organizations. Students are invited to submit project proposals for
   the open source projects that are most interesting to them. FreeBSD
   was one of the projects selected to participate in the inaugural
   Summer of Code in 2005 and we have participated each year since then.
   Over the past 4 years a total of 79 students have participated in the
   program and it has become a very significant source of new committers
   to FreeBSD. This talk will examine in detail the selection criteria
   for projects, the impact that successful projects have had, and some
   suggestions for how we can better leverage this program in the
   future.

   ABSD/UNIX operating system is traditionally split into two pieces:
   the kernel and userspace. Historically the reasons for this were
   clear: the UNIX kernel was a simple entity. However, over time the
   kernel has grown more and more complex. Currently, most of the same
   functionality is available both in userspace and the kernel, but
   under different names. Examples include synchronization routines and
   threading support. For instance, to lock a mutex in the NetBSD
   kernel, the call is mutex\_enter(), while in userspace the routine
   which does exactly the same thing is known as
   pthread\_mutex\_enter(). Taking another classic example, a BSD style
   OS has malloc()/free() available both in userspace and the kernel,
   but with different linkage (the kernel malloc interface is currently
   being widely deprecated, though). This imposes a completely arbitrary
   division between the kernel and userspace. Most functionality
   provided by an opearating system should be treated as a service
   instead of explicitly pinning it down as a userspace daemon or a
   kernel driver. Currently, due to the arbitrarily difference in
   programming interface names, functionality must be explicitly ported
   between the kernel and userspace if it is to run in one or the other
   environment. By unifying the environments where possible, the
   arbitrary division is weakened and porting between these environments
   becomes simpler. Antti Kantee has been a NetBSD developer for many
   many moons. He has managed to work on quite a few bits and pieces of
   a BSD system: userland utilities, the pkgsrc packaging system,
   networking, virtual memory, device drivers, hardware support and file
   systems. See also http://www.netbsd.org/docs/puffs/rump.htm

   This talk will present the different layers that handle input, from
   the key that gets pressed or the mouse motion to the applications,
   all the way through the kernel drivers, X drivers and libraries, in
   the case of the OpenBSD/NetBSD wscons driver and the current and
   future X.Org server. It will cover stuff like keyboard mappings,
   touch-screen calibration, multi-pointer X or input coordinates
   transformations. It will show some problems of current
   implementations and try to show how current evolutions can solve
   them. Matthieu Herrb is maintaing X on OpenBSD. I've been using X on
   various systems (SunOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X,...) since 1989. He
   has been a member of the XFree86 Core Team for a short period in 2003
   and is now a member of the X.Org Foundation BoD. Matthieu Herrb works
   at LAAS a research laborarory of the French National Research Agency
   (CNRS) both on robotics and network security.

   Recently I have been attending Hostobzor 12th, the Russian conference
   of hosting providers, beeing held at Raivola hotel near St.
   Petersburg. The event was great as always thanks to organizers. There
   was a number of intersting talks given, a lot of interesting
   discussions held, and, what I appreciate better, a lot of new people
   with great ideas met. I gave a talk on using the FreeBSD Ports system
   to mange a large-scale virtual hosting installations based on Hosting
   Telesystems experience. I tried to describe in detail how we use the
   ports collection to deploy a large number of servers diverced by
   architecture and OS versions, how we build packages and distribute
   them among servers, talked about how we use Mercurial VCS to
   incrementally merge upstream changes into our modified ports
   collection and FreeBSD src trees. Hopefully, I've not screwed it
   much... At least, some people was interested a lot and asked
   interesting questions.

   Sinds die tijd zijn er vele wegen geweest die ik behandeld heb, van
   documentatie projectleider naar Security Team-lid tot aan FreeBSD
   Developer. Remko Lodder is momenteel 25 jaar en werkt als Unix
   Engineer voor het bedrijf Snow B.V. waar hij zich momenteel met name
   bezig houd met security (firewalls etc). Hij is sinds 2004 lid van
   het FreeBSD Development team en is momenteel 1 van de meest actieve
   developers binnen het team.

   Hij zal daarbij met name ingaan wat de oorsprong en het ontstaan van
   een aantal \*BSD-projecten zijn. Hierbij zal hij zeer kort ingaan op
   de verschillende licentieproblemen die we in het verleden gezien
   hebben en worden een aantal bekende personen en data weer eens even

   Money can buy you bandwidth, but latency is forever! John Mashey,
   MIPS Victor will cover an array of issues connected to Postfix
   performance tuning, including: Latency, concurrency and throughput
   Postfix input processing Queue file format rationale Input processing
   bottlenecks Pre-queue filters, milters, content filters Tuning for
   fast (enough) input Postfix on-disk queues, requirements and
   architecture What is a "transport"? Postfix "nqmgr" scheduler
   algorithm Per-destination in memory queues Per-destination scheduler
   controls SMTP delivery Understanding delay logging Transport process
   limits, concurrency limits Scaling to thousands of output processes
   Connection caching, TLS session caching, feedback controls Speaker
   Bio Victor Duchovni trained in mathematics, switched tracks to CS in
   1980s leaving Princeton with a master's degree in mathematics and
   newly acquired skills in Unix system administration and system
   programming. In 1990 moved to Lehman Brothers, worked on system
   management tooling, and network engineering. Ported "Moira" from MIT
   to Lehman, built efficient build systems that predated (and partly
   inspired) Jumpstart. In 1994 joined ESM to market "CMDB" tools to
   enterprise users, but this did not pan out, in the mean time learned
   Tcl, and contributed bunch of patches to the 7.x early 8.x TCL
   releases. In 1997 returned to New York, working in IT Security at
   Morgan Stanley since late 1999. At Morgan Stanley, developed a hobby
   in perimeter email security, becoming an active Postfix user and very
   soon contributor in May of 2001. In addition to many smaller feature
   improvements, contributed initial implementation of SMTP connection
   caching, overhauled and currently maintain LDAP and TLS support. Made
   significant design contributions to queue manager in collaboration
   with Wietse and Patrik Raq. In 2.6 contributing support for TLS EC
   ciphers and multi-instance management tooling, ideally also TLS SNI
   if time permits.

   Many modern CPUs provide on chip counters for performance events such
   as retiring instructions and cache misses. The hwpmc driver and
   libraries in FreeBSD give systems administrators and programmers
   access to APIs which make it possible to measure performance without
   modifying source code and with minimal intrusion into application
   execution. This talk will be a brief introduction to HWPMC, and how
   to use it. Bio: George Neville-Neil is the co-author with Kirk
   McKusick of The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating
   System. He works on networking an operating systems for fun and
   profit.

   BSD vs GPL is a sweeping epic, focused on the dichotomy between good
   and evil. It peers inside the hearts and minds of the creators of
   these movements and dissects their battle for world domination. No
   common documentary will dare to follow the path that BSD vs GPL
   blazes.

   Two tools which have become the norm in Linux- and Unix-based
   environments are SSH for secure communications, and sudo for
   performing administrative tasks. These are independent programs with
   substantially different purposes, but they are often used in
   conjunction. In this talk, I describe a flaw in their interaction,
   and then present our solution called public-key sudo. Public-key sudo
   is an extension to the sudo authentication mechanism which allows for
   public key authentication using the SSH public key framework. I
   describe our implementation of a generic SSH authentication module
   and the sudo modifications required to use this module. Bio: Matthew

   Configuration Management with Cfengine Cfengine is a policy-based
   configuration management system. Its primary function is to provide
   automated configuration and maintenance of computers, from a policy
   specification. The cfengine project was started in 1993 as a reaction
   to the complexity and non-portability of shell scripting for Unix
   configuration management, and continues today. The aim was to absorb
   frequently used coding paradigms into a declarative, domain-specific
   language that would offer self-documenting configuration. about the

   technologies since as long as he can remember, starting out with a

   In his spare time he enjoys doing things with technology that have
   absolutely no redeeming social value.

   This talk is the result of an after-meeting discussion with a few
   folks, when it became apparent that there is some confusion as to how
   to deal with OpenBSD in small and large environments. The topic of
   installation and upgrading came up again. This talk is aimed to
   hopefully dispel many of the rumors, provide a thorough description
   and walk through of the various stages of running OpenBSD in any size
   environment, and some of the features and tools at the
   administrator's disposal. Okan Demirmen has been working with
   UNIX-like systems for as long as he can remember and has found
   OpenBSD to match some of the same philosophies in which he believes,
   namely simplicity and correctness, and reap the benefits of such.

   Special NYC\*BUG meeting with FreeBSD developer Brooks Davis Since
   late 2000 we have developed and maintained a general purpose
   technical and scientific computing cluster running the FreeBSD
   operating system. In that time we have grown from a cluster of 8 dual
   Intel Pentium III systems to our current mix of 64 dual, quad-core
   Intel Xeon and 289 dual AMD Opteron systems. In this talk we reflect
   on the system architecture as documented in our BSDCon 2003 paper
   "Building a High-performance Computing Cluster Using FreeBSD" and our
   changes since that time. After a brief overview of the current
   cluster we revisit the architectural decisions in that paper and
   reflect on their long term success. We then discuss lessons learned
   in the process. Finally, we conclude with thoughts on future cluster
   expansion and designs. Bio Brooks Davis is an Engineering Specialist
   in the High Performance Computing Section of the Computer Systems
   Research Department at The Aerospace Corporation. He has been a
   FreeBSD user since 1994, a FreeBSD committer since 2001, and a core
   team member since 2006. He earned a Bachelors Degree in Computer
   Science from Harvey Mudd College in 1998. His computing interests
   include high performance computing, networking, security, mobility,
   and, of course, finding ways to use FreeBSD in all these areas. When
   not computing, he enjoys reading, cooking, brewing and pounding on

   SSARES: Secure Searchable Automated Remote Email Storage - A usable,
   secure email system on a remote untrusted server The increasing
   centralization of networked services places user data at considerable
   risk. For example, many users store email on remote servers rather
   than on their local disk. Doing so allows users to gain the benefit
   of regular backups and remote access, but it also places a great deal
   of unwarranted trust in the server. Since most email is stored in
   plaintext, a compromise of the server implies the loss of
   confidentiality and integrity of the email stored therein. Although
   users could employ an end-to-end encryption scheme (e.g., PGP), such
   measures are not widely adopted, require action on the sender side,
   only provide partial protection (the email headers remain in the
   clear), and prevent the users from performing some common operations,
   such as server-side search. To address this problem, we present
   Secure Searchable Automated Remote Email Storage (SSARES), a novel
   system that offers a practical approach to both securing remotely
   stored email and allowing privacy-preserving search of that email
   collection. Our solution encrypts email (the headers, body, and
   attachments) as it arrives on the server using public-key encryption.
   SSARES uses a combination of Identity Based Encryption and Bloom
   Filters to create a searchable index. This index reveals little
   information about search keywords and queries, even against
   adversaries that compromise the server. SSARES remains largely
   transparent to both the sender and recipient. However, the system
   also incurs significant costs, primarily in terms of expanded storage
   requirements. We view our work as a starting point toward creating
   privacy-friendly hosted services. Angelos Keromytis is an Associate
   Professor with the Department of Computer Science at Columbia

   Cryptography has a reputation of slowing down applications. However
   if done correctly, it can actually be used to improve performance by
   storing high-value/high-cost results "in public." In addition the
   same techniques can solve common security problems such as
   authorization, parameter scanning, and parameter rewriting. All are
   welcome - no previous experience with cryptography is required, and
   the techniques will be presented in a programming-language neutral
   format. Nick Galbreath have been working on high performance servers
   and web security at various high profile startups since 1994 (most

   "The Real Unix Tradition" UNIX hackers, all standing on the shoulders
   of giants. "...the number of UNIX installations has grown to 10, with
   more expected..." - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, June 1972 "Well,
   it was all Open Source, before anybody really called it that". -
   Brian Redman, 2003 UNIX is the oldest active and growing computing
   culture alive today. From it's humble roots in the back room at Bell
   Laboratories, to today's global internet infrastructure- UNIX has
   consistently been at the core of major advances in computing. Today,
   the BSD legacy is the most direct continuation of the most successful
   principles in UNIX, and continues to lead major advances in
   computing. Why? What's so great about UNIX? This lecture aims to
   prove that UNIX history is surprisingly useful (and fun)- for
   developers, sysadmins, and anyone working with BSD systems. About the
   speaker Isaac Levy, (ike) is a freelance BSD hadker based in NYC. He
   runs Diversaform Inc. as an engine to make his hacking feed itself,
   (and ike). Diversaform specializes in \*BSD based solutions,
   providing 'IT special weapons and tatics' for various sized business
   clients, as well as running a small high-availability datacenter
   operation from lower Manhattan. With regard to FreeBSD jail(8), ike
   was a partner in the first jail (8)-based web hosting ISP in America,
   iMeme, and has been developing internet applications in and out of
   jails since 1999. Isaac is a proud member of NYC\*BUG (the New York

   The fourth annual pkgsrcCon is April 27-29 in Barcelona. As might be
   expected when brains congregate, pkgsrcCon traditionally results in a
   flurry of activity toward new directions and initiatives. Mere hours
   after returning to New York, Amitai will give us a recap of the
   proceedings, including his presentation, "Packaging djbware." Amitai

   It will talk about the origins of OpenRCS and OpenCVS, its real-world
   usage in the OpenBSD project, and why OpenBSD will continue to use
   CVS. Ray is an OpenBSD developer who uses Subversion by day, CVS by

   Integrated Enterprise Security Management Security policies are a key
   component in protecting enterprise networks. But, while there are
   many diverse defensive options available, current models and
   mechanisms for mechanically-enforced security policies are limited to
   traditional admission-based access control. Defensive capabilities
   include among others logging, firewalls, honeypots,
   rollback/recovery, and intrusion detection systems, while policy
   enforcement is essentially limited to one-off access control.
   Furthermore, access-control mechanisms operate independently on each
   service, which can (and often does) lead to inconsistent or incorrect
   application of the intended system-wide policy. We propose a new
   scheme for global security policies. Every policy decision is made
   with near-global knowledge, and re-evaluated as global knowledge
   changes. Using a variety of actuators, we make the full array of
   defensive capabilities available to the global policy. Our goal is a
   coherent, enterprise-wide response to any network threat. Biography

   The presentation will discuss Subversion from both client and server
   points of view. It will show how to create repositories and how to
   make them accessible over the network using different access schemes
   like http://, file:// or svn://. Pointers are given on securing the
   repositories and on authenticating and authorizing the clients. Next,
   the presentation shows how an user interacts with the repository and
   describes some of the important Subversion client commands. Finally,
   it deals with administrating the repository using "hook scripts".
   Ivan Ivanov is generally interested in Version Control Systems since
   his student years in Sofia University, Bulgaria, where he set up and
   maintained a CVS server for an academic project. When Subversion
   became a fact and proved to be "a better CVS" he researched it and
   last year deployed it for his NYC-based employer Ariel Partners
   (http://www.arielpartners.com/). He integrated the Subversion
   repositories with Apache Web Server over https to enable a reliable
   and secure way to access them from any point.

   UNIX professionals are busy these days. Setting up routers and
   firewalls are fundamental to any network, but in environments where
   the focus is on various applications, (servers, workstations, and the
   software that runs on them), it's difficult for a business not to
   choose off-the-shelf SOHO routers and networking gear. The web
   management GUIs are understandable by everyone, (even techs without
   UNIX knowledge), and the gear is cheap - this saves time and money.
   In the meantime, the features of your average Linksys or Netgear
   router often leave MUCH to be desired, (https auth management, for
   one simple example). Enter m0n0wall and PFSense, 2 BSD based packaged
   router/firewall solutions that are as solid and full featured as
   you'd expect from any BSD system- PLUS THEY HAVE HTML WEB INTERFACES
   FOR MANAGEMENT! m0n0wall and PFSense become an easy sell in any small
   professional environment, any competent tech can manage the network
   within minutes... At home, in every hackers home network, they free
   the hacker to have trusted tools available, but are as time-saving as
   using any Linksys router. m0n0wall and PFSense are both light and
   clean, designed to run on embedded systems- (Soekris, WRAP), but are
   monsters when unleashed on even legacy PCs around the office. If you
   manage UNIX networks and systems all day, do you really want to
   manage the router for your DSL when you get home? But then doesn't it
   bug you to use a chincey Linksys box? Ike has been a member of
   NYC\*BUG since we first launched in January 2004. He is a long-time

   Nearly 10 years ago Kirk McKusick wrote a history of the Berkeley
   Unix distributions for the O'Reilly book "Open Sources: Voices from
   the Open Source Revolution". We recommend you read his story,
   entitled "Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix From AT&T-Owned to Freely
   Redistributable" first, to see how Kirk remembers how we got here.
   Sadly, since it showed up in book form originally, this text has
   probably not been read by enough people. The USL(AT&T) vs BSDI/UCB
   court case settlement documents were not public until recently; their
   disclosure has made the facts more clear. But the story of how three
   people decided to free the BSD codebase of corporate pollution -- and
   release it freely -- is more interesting than the lawsuit which
   followed. Sure, a stupid lawsuit happened which hindered the
   acceptance of the BSD code during a critical period. But how did a
   bunch of guys go through the effort of replacing so much AT&T code in
   the first place? After all, companies had lots of really evil lawyers
   back then too -- were they not afraid? After a decade of development,
   most of the AT&T code had already been replaced by university
   researchers and their associates. So Keith Bostic, Mike Karels and
   Kirk McKusick (the main UCB CSRG group) started going through the
   4.3BSD codebase to cleanse the rest. Keith, in particular, built a
   ragtag team (in those days, USENIX conferences were a gold mine for
   such team building) and led these rebels to rewrite and replace all
   the Imperial AT&T code, piece by piece, starting with the libraries
   and userland programs. Anyone who helped only got credit as a
   Contributor -- people like Chris Torek and a cast of .. hundreds
   more. Then Mike and Kirk purified the kernel. After a bit more
   careful checking, this led to the release of a clean tree called
   Net/2 which was given to the world in June 1991 -- the largest dump
   of free source code the world had ever received (for those days --
   not modern monsters like OpenOffice). Some of these ragtags formed a
   company (BSDi) to sell a production system based on this free code
   base, and a year later Unix System Laboratories (basically AT&T) sued
   BSDi and UCB. Eventually AT&T lost and after a few trifling fixes
   (described in the lawsuit documents) the codebase was free. A few
   newer developments (and more free code) were added, and released in
   June 1994 as 4.4BSD-Lite. Just over 14 years later OpenBSD is
   releasing its own 4.4 release (and for a lot less than $1000 per
   copy). The OpenBSD 4.4 release is dedicated to Keith Bostic, Mike
   Karels, Kirk McKusick, and all of those who contributed to making
   Net/2 and 4.4BSD-Lite free.

   We are just plain tired of being lectured to by a man who is a lot
   like Naomi Campbell. In 1998 when a United Airlines plane was waiting
   in the queue at Washington Dulles International Airport for take-off
   to New Orleans (where a Usenix conference was taking place), one man
   stood up from his seat, demanded that they stop waiting in the queue
   and be permitted to deplane. Even after orders from the crew and a
   pilot from the cockpit he refused to sit down. The plane exited the
   queue and returned to the airport gangway. Security personnel ran
   onto the plane and removed this man, Richard Stallman, from the
   plane. After Richard was removed from the plane, everyone else stayed
   onboard and continued their journey to New Orleans. A few OpenBSD
   developers were on that same plane, seated very closeby, so we have
   an accurate story of the events. This is the man who presumes that he
   should preach to us about morality, freedom, and what is best for us.
   He believes it is his God-given role to tell us what is best for us,
   when he has shown that he takes actions which are not best for
   everyone. He prefers actions which he thinks are best for him -- and
   him alone -- and then lies to the public. Richard Stallman is no
   Spock. We release our software in ways that are maximally free. We
   remove all restrictions on use and distribution, but leave a
   requirement to be known as the authors. We follow a pattern of free
   source code distribution that started in the mid-1980's in Berkeley,
   from before Richard Stallman had any powerful influence which he
   could use so falsely. We have a development sub-tree called "ports".
   Our "ports" tree builds software that is 'found on the net' into
   packages that OpenBSD users can use more easily. A scaffold of
   Makefiles and scripts automatically fetch these pieces of software,
   apply patches as required by OpenBSD, and then build them into nice
   neat little tarballs. This is provided as a convenience for users.
   The ports tree is maintained by OpenBSD entirely separately from our
   main source tree. Some of the software which is fetched and compiled
   is not as free as we would like, but what can we do. All the other
   operating system projects make exactly the same decision, and provide
   these same conveniences to their users. Richard felt that this "ports
   tree" of ours made OpenBSD non-free. He came to our mailing lists and
   lectured to us specifically, yet he said nothing to the many other
   vendors who do the same; many of them donate to the FSF and perhaps
   that has something to do with it. Meanwhile, Richard has personally
   made sure that all the official GNU software -- including Emacs --
   compiles and runs on Windows. That man is a false leader. He is a
   hypocrite. There may be some people who listen to him. But we don't
   listen to people who do not follow their own stupid rules.

   Those of us who work on OpenBSD are often asked why we do what we do.
   This song's lyrics express the core motivations and goals which have
   remained unchanged over the years - secure, free, reliable software,
   that can be shared with anyone. Many other projects purport to share
   these same goals, and love to wrap themselves in a banner of "Open
   Source" and "Free Software". Given how many projects there are one
   would think it might be easy to stick to those goals, but it doesn't
   seem to work out that way. A variety of desires drag many projects
   away from the ideals very quickly. Much of any operating system's
   usability depends on device support, and there are some very tempting
   alternative ways to support devices available to those who will
   surrender their moral code. A project could compromise by entering
   into NDA agreements with vendors, or including binary objects in the
   operating system for which no source code exists, or tying their
   users down with contract terms hidden inside copyright notices. All
   of these choices surrender some subset of the ideals, and we simply
   will not do this. Sure, we care about getting devices working, but
   not at the expense of our original goals. Of course since "free to
   share with anyone" is part of our goals, we've been at the forefront
   of many licensing and NDA issues, resulting in a good number of
   successes. This success had led to much recognition for the
   advancement of Free Software causes, but has also led to other
   issues. We fully admit that some BSD licensed software has been taken
   and used by many commercial entities, but contributions come back
   more often than people seem to know, and when they do, they're always
   still properly attributed to the original authors, and given back in
   the same spirit that they were given in the first place. That's the
   best we can expect from companies. After all, we make our stuff so
   free so that everyone can benefit -- it remains a core goal; we
   really have not strayed at all in 10 years. But we can expect more
   from projects who talk about sharing -- such as the various Linux
   projects. Now rather than seeing us as friends who can cooperatively
   improve all codebases, we are seen as foes who oppose the GPL. The
   participants of "the race" are being manipulated by the FSF and their
   legal arm, the SFLC, for the FSF's aims, rather than the goal of
   getting good source into Linux (and all other code bases). We don't
   want this to come off as some conspiracy theory, but we simply urge
   those developers caution -- they should ensure that the path they are
   being shown by those who have positioned themselves as leaders is
   still true. Run for yourself, not for their agenda. The Race is there
   to be run, for ourselves, not for others. We do what we do to run our
   own race, and finish it the best we can. We don't rush off at every
   distraction, or worry how this will affect our image. We are here to
   have fun doing right.

   As developers of a free operating system, one of our prime
   responsibilities is device support. No matter how nice an operating
   system is, it remains useless and unusable without solid support for
   a wide percentage of the hardware that is available on the market. It
   is therefore rather unsurprising that more than half of our efforts
   focus on various aspects relating to device support. Most parts of
   the operating system (from low kernel, through to libraries, all the
   way up to X, and then even to applications) use fairly obvious
   interface layers, where the "communication protocols" or "argument
   passing" mechanisms (ie. APIs) can be understood by any developer who
   takes the time to read the free code. Device drivers pose an
   additional and significant challenge though: because many vendors
   refuse to document the exact behavior of their devices. The devices
   are black boxes. And often they are surprisingly weird, or even
   buggy. When vendor documentation does not exist, the development
   process can become extremely hairy. Groups of developers have found
   themselves focused for months at a time, figuring out the most simple
   steps, simply because the hardware is a complete mystery. Access to
   documentation can ease these difficulties rapidly. However, getting
   access to the chip documentation from vendors is ... almost always a
   negotiation. If we had open access to documentation, anyone would be
   able to see how simple all these devices actually are, and device
   driver development would flourish (and not just in OpenBSD, either).
   When we proceed into negotiations with vendors, asking for
   documentation, our position is often weak. One would assume that the
   modern market is fair, and that selling chips would be the primary
   focus of these vendors. But unfortunately a number of behemoth
   software vendors have spent the last 10 or 20 years building
   political hurdles against the smaller players. A particularly nasty
   player in this regard has been the Linux vendors and some Linux
   developers, who have played along with an American corporate model of
   requiring NDAs for chip documentation. This has effectively put Linux
   into the club with Microsoft, but has left all the other operating
   system communities -- and their developers -- with much less
   available clout for requesting documentation. In a more fair world,
   the Linux vendors would work with us, and the device driver support
   in all free operating systems would be fantastic by now. We only ask
   that users help us in changing the political landscape.

   The last 10 years, every 6 month period has (without fail) resulted
   in an official OpenBSD release making it to the FTP servers. But CDs
   are also manufactured, which the project sells to continue our
   development goals. While tests of the release binaries are done by
   developers around the world, Theo and some developers from Calgary or
   Edmonton (such as Peter Valchev or Bob Beck) test that the discs are
   full of (only) correct code. Ty Semaka works for approximately two
   months to design and draw artwork that will fit the designated theme,
   and coordinates with his music buddies to write and record a song
   that also matches the theme. Then the discs and all the artwork gets
   delivered to the plant, so that they can be pressed in time for an
   official release date. This release, instead of bemoaning vendors or
   organizations that try to make our task of writing free software more
   difficult, we instead celebrate the 10 years that we have been given
   (so far) to write free software, express our themes in art, and the 5
   years that we have made music with a group of talented musicians.
   OpenBSD developers have been torturing each other for years now with
   Humppa-style music, so this release our users get a taste of this
   too. Sometimes at hackathons you will hear the same songs being
   played on multiple laptops, out of sync. It is under such duress that
   much of our code gets written. We feel like Pufferix and Bobilix
   delivering The Three Discs of Freedom to those who want them whenever
   the need arises, then returning to celebrate the (unlocked) source
   tree with all the other developers. For RSS readers: Please note that
   the download URL is an FTP site.

   Last month I attended a meeting of the Ottawa Amateur Radio Club
   (OARC) as a member of my local BUG was giving a presentation on Ham
   Radio on FreeBSD. Diane Bruce, call sign VA3DB, has had her operator
   license since 1969 and is well known in the BSD community and for the
   development of ircd-hybrid. In the past year she has assisted in the
   creation of the Hamradio category in the FreeBSD ports tree and has
   become the maintainer of over 20 of the hamradio ports. She also
   contributed to the FreeBSD entry at Hampedia, the Wikipedia for ham
   operators. Her presentation slides are a great introduction to the
   various ham utilities which are available, including both
   descriptions and screenshots of the utilities in action.

   control kernel modules to be loaded, modifying the security behavior
   of the operating system, including SEBSD, a port of the SELinux
   FLASK/TE security model to FreeBSD.

   EuroBSDCon 2006 took place in Milan, Italy, and not only offered
   excellent food on a flexible schedule, but also an interesting array
   of talks on work spanning the BSD's. On this page, you can find my
   slides from the FreeBSD developer summit and full conference. Status
   report on the TrustedBSD Project: introduction and status regarding
   Audit, plus a TODO list; introduction to the priv(9) work recently
   merged to 7.x. The FreeBSD Project is one of the oldest and most
   successful open source operating system projects, seeing wide
   deployment across the IT industry. From the root name servers, to top
   tier ISPs, to core router operating systems, to firewalls, to
   embedded appliances, you can't use a networked computer for ten
   minutes without using FreeBSD dozens of times. Part of FreeBSD's
   reputation for quality and reliability comes from the nature of its
   development organization--driven by a hundreds of highly skilled
   volunteers, from high school students to university professors. And
   unlike most open source projects, the FreeBSD Project has developers
   who have been working on the same source base for over twenty years.
   But how does this organization work? Who pays the bandwidth bills,
   runs the web servers, writes the documentation, writes the code, and
   calls the shots? And how can developers in a dozen time zones reach
   agreement on the time of day, let alone a kernel architecture? This
   presentation will attempt to provide, in 45 minutes, a brief if
   entertaining snapshot into what makes FreeBSD run.

   Maste, who have my greatest appreciation! The FreeBSD SMPng Project
   has spent the past five years redesigning and reimplementing SMP
   support for the FreeBSD operating system, moving from a Giant-locked
   kernel to a fine-grained locking implementation with greater kernel
   threading and parallelism. This paper introduces the FreeBSD SMPng
   Project, its architectural goals and implementation approach. It then
   explores the impact of SMPng on the FreeBSD network stack, including
   strategies for integrating SMP support into the network stack,
   locking approaches, optimizations, and challenges.

   We talk with Daniel Seuffert about BSD. Several flavours of BSD were
   represented in a joint BSD booth: OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and MirOS.
   Daniel is representative of the FreeBSD project and among other
   things talks about the different operating systems that are build on
   top of FreeBSD. For instance, there are two distributions called
   PC-BSD and DesktopBSD that are targeted towards desktop users. There
   also is a version that specializes on security entitled TrustedBSD.

   The talk will introduce packet filter (pf) - a \*BSD firewall system
   - and summarize its history and projected future. After providing a
   short overview of pf's general functionality and some firewall
   basics, it will concentrate on packet filter's advanced feature-set
   from the administrator's point of view. The talk will also cover the
   integration of ALTQ, a mature framework for traffic shaping and
   priorization. Finally it will provide a short overview of the "Common
   Address Redundancy Protocol" (CARP) and its integration in pf.

   UNIX is the best operating system ever designed so everybody is
   running UNIX on their computer, right ? This presentation takes a
   partisan looks a why UNIX never became a big success in the eighties,
   failed to win the market in the nineties, and still struggles in the
   market in the new millennium. Poul-Henning will take a critical look
   at the mistakes of the past and the mistakes of the present and try
   to make it really clear what needs to happen for UNIX to become a
   real success.

   A sneak peak into the FreeBSD development process. Warning 2 hours!
   filmed over 2 days. (The schedule worked out was optimistic to say
   the least but it's still looking ok...) Marko Zec and Julian Elischer
   report back to the developers at BSDCan on the progress on
   virtualizing the network stack in FreeBSD. This has been a long term
   project but at the time of this recording was just reaching the point
   of feasibility. In this video you can see some of the dynamics of the
   group as developers become familiar with the project and discussions
   take place regarding such things as maintainability, ABI
   compatibility, and even what to call the feature. In this video you
   can see the decision being made by a "quorum" of developers to take
   this project mainstream. The sound is less that perfect, but it's
   what we have. This is a montage of 3 video sources, one of which is a
   lower resolution, but at times it was the only camera capturing the
   action. (the other ran out of tape for a while) Thanks to Ed Maste
   for the added footage. I will be doing more editing later and will be
   substituting in better footage in some places. clive URL:

   BSD vs GPL is a sweeping epic, focused on the dichotomy between good
   and evil. It peers inside the hearts and minds of the creators of
   these movements and dissects their battle for world domination. No
   common documentary will dare to follow the path that BSD vs GPL
   blazes. This presentation was given by Jason Dixon at the NYC BSD
   Conference at Columbia University on October 11, 2008 clive URL:

   A tongue-in-cheek look at the history and future of the BSD movement.
   Modeled after the presentation styles of Lessig and Hardt, the talk
   provides a light-hearted introspection of the leaders, technologies,
   and community that forges ahead despite having been left for dead
   some 15 years past. This presentation was given by Jason Dixon at the

   Registration is open for NYCBSDCon and the list of speakers is

   that is known to work well on the BSDs? Are there any live CDs like
   Dyne:bolic? I've come into possession of a Soekris 5501. What are
   your suggestions for soekris-friendly projects to test?

   Setting up a central syslog server. If you are concerned about the
   security of your logs, use a dedicated machine and lock it down. Keep
   clocks in sync. You may need to change log rotation schedule in
   /etc/newsyslog.conf. You can rotate based in size and/or time. This
   can be as much a policy decision as a hardware decision. On central
   log host, change syslogd flags to listen to network. Each BSD does
   this differently, so check the man pages. Also, check out the -n flag
   for busy environments. Make sure host firewall allows syslog traffic
   through. Be careful to limit syslog traffic to just the trusted
   network or hosts. FreeBSD man page refers to syslogd as a "remote
   disk filling service". For heavy logging environments, it is
   important to have a dedicated network. A down syslogd server can
   create a lot of "ARP who-has" broadcasts. Most network devices such
   as printers and commercial firewalls support sending to a central
   syslog server. Take a look at "Snare" for Windows hosts. To send
   messages from a Unix host, specify the host name prepended with @
   instead of a file for logging in /etc/syslog.conf. For example,
   change /var/log/xferlog to @loghost.mydomain.biz. You can also copy
   and edit the line to have it log to both a local file and a remote
   host.

   Why I like the CLI: Uses minimal resources. Less space, less memory,
   fewer dependencies. Transparency. GUI hides internals, limits
   options. Similar between Unix-like systems. GUI tools seem to change
   every week. Remote management. SSH rocks. Everything is text.
   Configs, devices, output. CLI is natural complement. Pipes and
   scripts. One time is hard, a thousand times is easy. Only need a few
   tools. Grep, sed, awk, vi, cron. Text config files. Easy to version,
   share, and comment. Requires reading skills instead of clicking
   skills. Much faster when you know what you are doing.

   Important when you don't trust the computer you are using, such as a
   library computer or internet kiosk. Available by default in
   Free/Net/Open BSD. FreeBSD uses OPIE, Net/Open use S/Key. One time
   passwords are based on your pass phrase, a non-repeating sequence
   number, and a seed. Initial setup should be done directly on the
   server. "skeyinit" for Net/Open, "opiepasswd -c" for FreeBSD. Enter a
   pass phrase that is not your regular account password. Find your
   current sequence number and seed with "opieinfo" or "skeyinfo", for
   example: "497 pc5246". Generate a list of the next 10 passwords and
   write them down, using "opiekey -n 10 497 pc5246" or "skey -n 10 497
   pc5246". When you log in from a remote machine that might have a
   keystroke logger, you can now use a one time password instead of your
   regular password. For OpenBSD, log in as account:skey, for example
   "bob:skey", which will cause the system to present the s/key
   challenge. For NetBSD, the system will always present you with the
   s/key challenge if it is configured for your account, although you
   can still use your regular password. FreeBSD by default will force
   you to use a one time password if it is configured for your account.
   If you want both OPIE and password authentication, FreeBSD allows you
   to list trusted networks or hosts in /etc/opieaccess. Instead of
   carrying a list of passwords around, you can use s/key generators on
   a portable device that you trust, such as a palm pilot. For more
   info, check the man pages.
