Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Java? on FreeBSD <../java/index.html>`__: This contains information
   on where to obtain the latest JDK? for FreeBSD, how to install and
   run it, and a list of Java? software that you may find interesting.
-  `GNOME on FreeBSD <../gnome/index.html>`__: This contains information
   on where to obtain the latest GNOME for FreeBSD, how to install and
   run it, latest project news and updates, FAQ covering
   FreeBSD-specific GNOME issues, application porting guidelines and
   much more.
-  `KDE on FreeBSD <http://freebsd.kde.org>`__: This contains links to
   the latest KDE releases for FreeBSD, as well as documentation and
   tutorials about how to install and run KDE on FreeBSD. Project news
   and a FreeBSD-specific FAQ are also available.
-  `Mono on FreeBSD <http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:FreeBSD>`__: Here
   you can find information about the state of Mono and C# for FreeBSD.
-  `OpenOffice.org on
   FreeBSD <http://porting.openoffice.org/freebsd/>`__: Information
   about the various OpenOffice.org ports.
-  `FreeBSD Ports Collection <../ports/index.html>`__: The FreeBSD Ports
   Collection provides an easy way to compile and install a wide range
   of applications with a minimum amount of effort. A list of current
   ports is available along with a search mechanism to see if a specific
   application exists in the Ports Collection.
-  `FreeBSD Ports distfiles scanner <http://portscout.FreeBSD.org/>`__:
   A list which checks the Ports Collection for unfetchable distfiles
   and provides a summary for each port.
-  `FreshPorts <http://FreshPorts.org/>`__: Provides the most up-to-date
   list of ports and port changes. Add your favourite ports to your
   watch list and receive email notification of any changes.
-  `PortsMon <http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/>`__: Is a server which checks
   the Ports Collection and keeps package building logs and error logs
   for each port.

Networking
~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Netperf <../projects/netperf/index.html>`__: Network stack
   performance and optimization, a follow-on to the SMPng network stack
   locking work for FreeBSD 5.3. This project is exploring and
   implementing optimizations strategies for a multi-threaded network
   stack.
-  `KAME Project <http://www.kame.net/>`__: A free IPv6/IPsec stack for
   BSD.
-  `SYSLOG-SECURE <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3164.html>`__: In August
   2001 a standard of syslog was made: RFC3164. This RFC describes some
   extensions to add security to syslog. A project started in 2002 to
   adapt RFC3164 to the FreeBSD version of syslog and to add some
   security extensions, at least syslog-sign. Both libc and syslogd will
   be modified. And optionally some tools to verify or manage the
   security would be made. All help is welcome. Send an email to
   albert@ons-huis.net for info.

Storage
~~~~~~~

-  `Arla <http://www.stacken.kth.se/projekt/arla/>`__: A free AFS client
   implementation. The main goal is to make a fully functional client
   with all capabilities of normal AFS. Other planned and implemented
   things are all the normal management tools and a server.
-  `Coda <http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/>`__: A distributed filesystem.
   Among its features are disconnected operation, good security model,
   server replication and persistent client side caching.
-  `Journaling versus Soft
   Updates <http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/papers/>`__: Asynchronous
   Meta-data Protection in File Systems.
-  `Tertiary Disk <http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/Td/>`__: A storage system
   architecture to create large disk storage systems that avoid the
   disadvantages of custom built disk arrays. The name comes from twin
   goals: to have the cost per megabyte and capacity of tape libraries
   and the performance of magnetic disks. We use commodity, off the
   shelf components to develop a scalable, low cost, terabyte capacity
   disk system. Our target is to build a complete storage system with
   about 30-50% extra to the cost of the raw disk. Tertiary Disk uses
   PCs connected by a switched network to host a large number of disks.
   Our prototype consists of 20 200MHz PC PCs, which host 370 8GB disks.
   The PCs are connected through a 100Mbps Ethernet switch.
-  `Vinum <http://www.vinumvm.org/>`__: A logical volume manager modeled
   after the VERITAS volume manager™. However, it is not a clone of
   Veritas, and attempts to solve a number of problems more elegantly
   than Veritas. It also offers features that Veritas does not have.

Kernel, security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `OpenBSM <http://www.OpenBSM.org/>`__: An open source implementation
   of Sun's Basic Security Module (BSM) Audit API and file format.
   OpenBSM provides the userland libraries, tools, and documentation for
   the TrustedBSD audit implementation that will be integrated into
   FreeBSD.
-  `TrustedBSD <http://www.TrustedBSD.org/>`__: Provides a set of
   trusted operating system extensions to the FreeBSD operating system.
   This includes features such as fine-grained privileges
   (capabilities), Access Control Lists, and Mandatory Access Control.
   These features are being integrated back into the base FreeBSD
   distribution, as well as being ported to other BSD-derived systems.
-  `Kernel Stress Test Suite <http://www.holm.cc/stress/>`__: The
   purpose of this stress test is to crash the system. The stress test
   is composed of small test programs and scripts. Each test targets a
   specific area of the kernel. The key concept of this test suite is
   chaos. Each test sleeps for a random number of seconds before it
   starts up in a random number of invocations.

Device drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `busdma and SMPng driver
   conversion <../projects/busdma/index.html>`__: busdma provides a
   portable abstraction to the Direct Memory Access (DMA) hardware
   primitives used by many high performance device drivers. By using
   this abstraction, device driver authors avoid adding
   platform-specific DMA management code, improving the portability of
   drivers between hardware architectures. This page also tracks the
   progress of drivers towards being SMPng-safe.
-  `Home
   Automation <http://people.FreeBSD.org/~fsmp/HomeAuto/HomeAuto.html>`__:
   Using FreeBSD to run appliance controllers, infra-red controllers,
   automated telephone systems, and more.
-  Xircom CEM Ethernet Driver: A mailing list exists for further
   development of Scott Mitchell's Xircom CEM ethernet driver. Send
   ``subscribe freebsd-xircom`` to majordomo@lovett.com to join.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Porting FreeBSD to IA-64 systems <../platforms/ia64/index.html>`__:
   This project is responsible for porting FreeBSD to the IA-64
   architecture. Direct any questions specific to this project to the
   freebsd-ia64@FreeBSD.org mailing list.
-  `Porting FreeBSD to PowerPC? systems <../platforms/ppc.html>`__:
   Contains information on the FreeBSD PPC port, such as mailing list
   information and so on.
-  `Porting FreeBSD to SPARC? systems <../platforms/sparc.html>`__:
   Contains information on the FreeBSD SPARC port including a FAQ, some
   early boot code, information on SPARC processors and motherboards,
   and other SPARC projects.
-  `SysVR4 Emulation <http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/freebsd-svr4/>`__:
   This page describes an SysVR4 emulator for FreeBSD. It is currently
   capable of running (or walking, in some cases) a wide-ish variety of
   SysV executables taken from Solaris™/x86 2.5.1 and 2.6 systems. I
   have reason to believe that it will also run SCO UnixWare and SCO
   OpenServer binaries.
-  `The OSKit <http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/>`__: The OSKit is a
   framework and a set of 31 component libraries oriented to operating
   systems, together with extensive documentation. By providing in a
   modular way not only most of the infrastructure "grunge" needed by an
   OS, but also many higher-level components, the OSKit's goal is to
   lower the barrier to entry to OS R&D and to lower its costs. The
   OSKit makes it vastly easier to create a new OS, port an existing OS
   to the x86 (or in the future, to other architectures supported by the
   OSkit), or enhance an OS to support a wider range of devices,
   filesystem formats, executable formats, or network services. The
   OSKit also works well for constructing OS-related programs, such as
   boot loaders or OS-level servers atop a microkernel.

Misc
~~~~

-  `NanoBSD <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/nanobsd/index.html>`__:
   NanoBSD is a tool designed to create a possibly reduced FreeBSD
   system image, which is suited to fit on a Compact Flash card (or
   other mass storage medium) in a way which is suitable for use in
   appliance like applications. The FreeBSD documentation collection
   includes an introductory `article about
   NanoBSD <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/nanobsd/index.html>`__,
   which includes useful tips about setting up, running and using
   NanoBSD.
-  `GLOBAL <http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html>`__: A common
   source code tag system that works the same way across diverse
   environments. Currently, it supports the shell command line, the nvi
   editor, web browser, the emacs editor, and the elvis editor, and the
   supported languages are C, Yacc, and Java.
-  `ACPI on FreeBSD <../projects/acpi/>`__: A Project created to get
   ACPI working smoothly on FreeBSD.
-  `Binary Updater <http://www.daemonology.net/freebsd-update/>`__:
   FreeBSD Update is a system for automatically building, distributing,
   fetching, and applying binary security updates for FreeBSD. This
   makes it possible to easily track the FreeBSD security branches
   without the need for fetching the source tree and recompiling (except
   on the machine building the updates, of course). Updates are
   cryptographically signed; they are also distributed as binary diffs
   using a binary diff tool, which dramatically reduces the bandwidth
   used.
-  `CVSweb <cvsweb.html>`__: A WWW interface for CVS repositories with
   which you can browse a file hierarchy on your browser to view each
   file's revision history in a very handy manner.
-  `TET Integration <http://wiki.freebsd.org/TetIntegration>`__: The
   Test Execution Toolkit from `The Open
   Group <http://www.opengroup.org/>`__ is a light-weight open-source
   test execution framework that supports distributed testing. This
   project investigates using TET and existing TET-based open-source
   standards-compliance test suites (VSX-PCTS, VSC-Lite, VSTH-Lite, VSW5
   and others) in FreeBSD.
