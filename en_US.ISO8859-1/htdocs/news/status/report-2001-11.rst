Introduction
============

This months report covers activity during the second half of October,
and the month of November. During these months, substantial work was
performed to improve system performance and stability, in particular
addressing concerns regarding regressions in network performance for the
TCP protocol, and via the introduction of polled network device driver
support. Work continues on long-term architectural projects for 5.0,
including KSEs, NEWCARD, and TrustedBSD, as well as the cleaning up of
long-standing problems in FreeBSD, such as PAM integration.
Administrative changes are also documented, including work to redefine
and formalize the release engineering process, and the approval of a new
portmgr group which will administer the ports collection.

FreeBSD users and developers are strongly encouraged to attend the
USENIX BSD Conference in February of next year; it is expected that this
will be a useful forum both for learning about FreeBSD and on-going
work, as well as providing an opportunity for developers to work more
closely and act as a vehicle for discussion and round-the-clock hacking.
More information is available at the USENIX web site.

ATA Project Status Report
-------------------------

Contact: S?ren Schmidt <sos@FreeBSD.org\ >

Work is underways to support failing mirror disks better and handle
hotswapping in a new replacement disk and have it rebuild automagically.

Support for the Promise TX4 is now working in my lab, seems they did the
PCI-PCI bridging in the not so obvious way.

Plans are in the works to backport the -current ATA driver to -stable
with hotswap and the works. Now that -current is delayed I'm working on
ways to give me time to get this done, since I've had lots of requests
lately and we really can't let down our customers :).

SMART support is being worked on, but no timelines yet.

Although not strictly ATA, Promise has equipped me with a couple
SuperTrak sx6000 RAID controllers, they take 6 ATA disks and does
RAID0-5 in hardware. I have done a driver (its an I2O device) for both
-current and -stable and it works beautifully with hotswap the works. It
will enter the tree when it is more mature, and I have an agreement with
Promise on how we handle userland control util etc. BTW it seems it can
also be used as a normal 6 channel PCI ATA controller, a bit on the
expensive side maybe...

--------------

Device Polling
--------------

URL: http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/polling/

Contact: Luigi Rizzo <luigi@iet.unipi.it\ >

This work uses a mixed interrupt-polling architecture to handle network
device drivers, giving the system substantial improvements in terms of
stability and robustness to overloads, as well as the ability to control
the sharing of CPU between network-related kernel processing and other
user/kernel tasks. Last not least, you might even see a moderate (up to
20-30%, machine dependent) performance improvement.

--------------

Fibre Channel Support
---------------------

URL: http://www.feral.com/isp.html

Contact: Matthew Jacob <mjacob@feral.com\ >

Ongoing bug fixes. Work is underway, to be integrated shortly, that
makes the cross platform endian support easier and will prepare the
FreeBSD version for eventual sparc64 and PowerPC usage.

--------------

FreeBSD 4.5 Release Engineering
-------------------------------

| URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/internal/releng.html
|  URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/internal/releng45.html

Contact: Murray Stokely <murray@FreeBSD.org\ >

Release engineering activities for FreeBSD 4.5 have begun. An overview
of the entire process has been added to the FreeBSD web site, along with
a specific schedule for 4.5. The code freeze is scheduled to start on
December 20. The team responsible for responding to MFC requests sent to
re@FreeBSD.org for this release is: Murray Stokely, Robert Watson, and
John Baldwin. Some of our many goals for this release include closing
more installation-related problem reports, being more conservative with
our approval of changes during the code freeze, and continuing to
document the entire process. For suggestions or questions about FreeBSD
4.5 release activities, please subscribe to the public
freebsd-qa@FreeBSD.org mailing list.

--------------

FreeBSD C99 & POSIX Conformance Project
---------------------------------------

URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~mike/c99/

| Contact: Mike Barcroft <mike@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: FreeBSD-Standards Mailing List <standards@FreeBSD.org\ >

Work on the FreeBSD C99 & POSIX Conformance Project is progressing
nicely. Since the last status report, two new headers have been added
[<stdint.h> and <inttypes.h>], several new functions implemented
[atoll(3), imaxabs(3), imaxdiv(3), llabs(3), lldiv(3), strerror\_r(3),
strtoimax(3), and strtoumax(3)], and changes to assert(3) and printf(3)
were made to support C99. More printf(3) changes are in the works to
support the remaining C99 and POSIX requirements. Additionally, research
was done into our POSIX Utility conformance and a list of tasks was
derived from that research.

Several other interesting events occurred during November and the
beginning of December. The project mailing list was moved to the
FreeBSD.org domain, and is now available at standards@FreeBSD.org. On
December 6, 2001, the IEEE Standards Board approved the Austin Group
Specification as IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, thus making the work we're doing
ever more important.

--------------

FreeBSD in Bulgarian
--------------------

| URL: http://www.FreeBSD-bg.ringlet.net/
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~roam/bg/

Contact: Peter Pentchev <roam@FreeBSD.org\ >

The FreeBSD in Bulgarian project aims to bring a more comfortable
working environment to Bulgarian users of the FreeBSD OS. This includes,
but is not limited to, font, keymap and locale support, translation of
the FreeBSD documentation into Bulgarian, local user groups and various
forms of on-line help channels and discussion forums to help Bulgarians
adopt and use FreeBSD.

Bulgarian locale support has been committed to FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT (and
later merged into 4.x-STABLE on December 10th). A local CVS repository
for the translation of the FreeBSD documentation into Bulgarian has been
created.

--------------

FreeBSD NVIDIA Driver Port
--------------------------

| URL: ftp://ftp.jurai.net/users/winter/nvidia/NEWS
|  URL: ftp://ftp.jurai.net/users/winter/nvidia/

Contact: Matthew N. Dodd <mdodd@FreeBSD.org\ >

The port of the driver is around 90% feature complete. AGP support and
"Registry" support via sysctl need to be finished/implemented. The
NVIDIA guys are working on a build of the X11 libs and extensions for
FreeBSD; once this is done hardware accelerated direct rendering should
work. The previous version this driver is no longer available. I'm
planning on making a snapshot of my code once I chase out a few more
bugs.

Please note that development is taking place under -CURRENT right now; a
port to -STABLE will be available at some later time.

--------------

GEOM - generalized block storage manipulation
---------------------------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/~phk/Geom/

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org\ >

This project is now finally underway, thanks to DARPA and NAI getting a
sponsorship lined up. The infrastructure code and data structures are
currently taking form inside a userland simulation harness.

--------------

Improving FreeBSD startup scripts
---------------------------------

| URL: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FreeBSD-rc/
|  URL: http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/~lukem/bibliography.html
|  URL: http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/rc/

| Contact: Doug Barton Committer <DougB@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Gordon Tetlow Contributor <gordont@gnf.org\ >

<-- from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FreeBSD-rc/ -->
This group is for discussion about the startup scripts in FreeBSD,
primarily the scripts in /etc/rc\*. Primary focus will be on
improvements and importation of NetBSD's excellent work on this topic.

<-- from Gordon Tetlow's ranting -->
Due to personal commitments by the folks working on this project we have
been unable to spend much time porting the rc.d infrastructure into the
FreeBSD boot framework.

Currently, the system will boot (with a little fudging) just before
network utilization. There are patches floating around for this (see the
-arch list from September).

--------------

Intel Gigabit Driver: wx desupported
------------------------------------

Contact: Matthew Jacob <mjacob@feral.com\ >

The wx driver is desupported and removed from -current. No further
support for wx in -stable is planned. Newer and better drivers are now
in the tree.

--------------

jp.FreeBSD.org daily SNAPSHOTs project
--------------------------------------

| URL: http://snapshots.jp.FreeBSD.org/
|  URL: ftp://snapshots.jp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/i386/

Contact: Makoto Matsushita <matusita@jp.FreeBSD.org\ >

jp.FreeBSD.org daily SNAPSHOTs project is yet another snapshots server
that provides latest 4-stable and 5-current distribution. You also find
installable ISO image, live filesystem, HTMLed source code with search
engine, and more; please check project webpage for more details.

--------------

jpman project
-------------

URL: http://www.jp.FreeBSD.org/man-jp/

Contact: Kazuo Horikawa <horikawa@FreeBSD.org\ >

Targeting 4.5-RELEASE, we continued to revising
doc/ja\_JP.eucJP/man/man[1256789] to catch up with RELENG\_4. Section 3
updating has 45% finished.

--------------

KSEs
----

| URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/~julian/
|  URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/~jasone/kse/

Contact: Julian Elischer <julian@FreeBSD.org\ >

I have been working behind the scenes on design rather than programming
for this last month. I have been working however in the p4 tree to make
the system run with the thread structure NOT a part of the proc
structure (a prerequisite for threading)

--------------

LOMAC Status Report
-------------------

URL: http://opensource.nailabs.com/lomac/

Contact: Brian Feldman <green@FreeBSD.org\ >

A FreeBSD -CURRENT snapshot with LOMAC is currently being prepared, with
aid of Perforce on the "green\_lomac" branch. Very soon there should be
a working demonstration installation CD of FreeBSD with LOMAC, including
the ability to enable LOMAC in rc.conf with sysinstall, being a
legitimate "out-of-the-box" FreeBSD experience. Actual release build is
pending debugging issues with program start-up (especially xdm).

--------------

Network interface cloning and modularity
----------------------------------------

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >

Support for VLAN cloning has been merged from current and will ship with
4.5-RELEASE. Additionally, new rc.conf support for cloning interfaces at
boot has been MFD'd. Work is ongoing to MFC stf and faith cloning as
well as adding cloning for ppp devices and enhancing VLAN modularity.

--------------

New mount(2) API
----------------

URL: http://www.sneakerz.org/~mux/mount.diff

| Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Maxime Henrion <mux@qualys.com\ >

There is now some code ready for the new mount API, which has to be
reviewed and tested. If it is adopted, we will probably start converting
all the filesystems, as well as other code in the kernel, to make them
use it. If you want to play with it, the patch is available at the above
URL.

--------------

NEWCARD/OLDCARD Status report
-----------------------------

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org\ >

Not much to report. A number of minor bugs in OLDCARD have been
corrected. A larger number of machines now work. Additional work on
ToPIC support has been committed, but continued lack of a suitable ToPIC
machine has left the author unable to do much work. A few stubborn
machines still need to be supported (the author has an example of one
such machine, so there is hope for it being fixed. Some pci related
issues remain for both OLDCARD and NEWCARD.

NEWCARD work is ramping up, while OLDCARD work is ramping down. A number
of things remain to be done for NEWCARD, including suspend/ resume
support, generic device arrival/removal daemon and hopefully automatic
loading of drivers. A number of current pccard drivers still need to be
converted to NEWBUS. Several Chipset issues remain, as does the merging
of isa pccard bridge code with the pccbb code.

--------------

Pluggable Authentication Modules
--------------------------------

URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~des/diary/2001.html

| Contact: Mark Murray <markm@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Dag-Erling Sm?rgrav <des@FreeBSD.org\ >

On the code side, a number of libpam bugs have been fixed; a new PAM
module, ``pam_self(8)`` , has been written; and preparations have been
made for the transition from ``/etc/pam.conf`` to ``/etc/pam.d`` .

On the documentation side, new manual pages have been written for
``pam_ssh(8)`` , ``pam_get_item(3)`` and ``pam_set_item(3)`` , and work
has started on a longer article about PAM which is expected to be
finished by the end of the year.

A lot of work still remains to be done to integrate PAM more tightly
with the FreeBSD base system—particularly the ``passwd(1)`` ,
``chpass(1)`` etc. utilities—and ports collection.

--------------

Ports Manager Team (portmgr)
----------------------------

URL: http://bento.FreeBSD.org/

Contact: Will Andrews <will@FreeBSD.org\ >

After a discussion with the Core Team about our status regarding the
ports collection, we heard from them that they'd decided to recognize us
as the final authority for approving ports committers. We've spent the
last few weeks working on our ports build cluster (see the link) and
trying to find ways to improve it for the ports development community.
We've also handled a few minor issues in the ports collection.

--------------

RELNOTESng
----------

| URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~bmah/relnotes/
|  URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/relnotes.html

Contact: Bruce Mah <bmah@FreeBSD.org\ >

I've been working on making the Hardware Notes less i386-centric. This
will be especially important for -CURRENT as the ia64 and sparc ports
reach maturity; most of this work should be completed in time to be
MFC-ed for FreeBSD 4.5-RELEASE. I encourage any interested parties to
review the release documentation and send me comments or patches.

--------------

Revised {mode,log}page support for camcontrol
---------------------------------------------

Contact: Kelly Yancey <kbyanc@FreeBSD.org\ >

Extending camcontrol's page definition file format to include both
modepage and logpage definitions; adding support to camcontrol to query
and reset log page parameters. Consideration is being made to possibly
include support for diagnostic and vital product data pages, but that is
outside the current project scope. New page definition file format
includes capability to conditionally include page definitions based on
SCSI INQUIRY results allowing vendor-specific pages to be described
also. Approximately 80% complete.

--------------

SMPng Status Report
-------------------

| Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: <smp@FreeBSD.org\ >

October ended up being a bit busier than November for SMPng. During
October, Peter Wemm finally finished the ambitious task of unwinding all
the macros in NFS and splitting it up into two halves: client and
server. Andrew Reiter also submitted some code to add locks to
taskqueues, and the folks working on the TTY subsystem designed the
locking strategy they will be using. Per-thread ucred references were
also added for user traps and syscalls. Once the necessary locking on
the process ucred references is committed, this will allow kernel code
to access the credentials of the current thread without needing locks
while also ensuring that a thread has constant credentials for the
lifetime of a syscall. November only saw a few small bug fixes
unfortunately, but December is already shaping up to be a very active
month, so next month's report should be a bit more interesting.

In non-coding news, the website for the SMPng project has moved from its
old location to the new location above. Also, I have completed a paper I
am presenting for BSDCon regarding the SMPng project. The paper will be
available in the conference proceedings and will be available online
after the conference as well.

--------------

Status Report: mb\_alloc (-CURRENT mbuf allocator)
--------------------------------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/~bmilekic/code/mb_alloc/

Contact: Bosko Milekic <bmilekic@FreeBSD.org\ >

Presently re-style(9)ing mbuf code with the help of Bruce (bde). The
next larger step is approaching: to better performance, as initially
planned, not have reference counters for clusters allocated separately
via malloc(9). Rather, use some of the [unused] space at the end of each
cluster as a counter; since this space is totally unused and since ref.
counter <--> mbuf cluster is a one-to-one relationship, this is most
convenient.

--------------

TCP Performance Improvements
----------------------------

Contact: Matthew Dillon <dillon@FreeBSD.org\ >

A number of serious TCP bugs effecting throughput snuck into the system
over the last few releases and have finally been fixed. TCP performance
should be greatly improved for a number of cases, including TCP/NFS.

--------------

TrustedBSD Audit
----------------

URL: http://www.TrustedBSD.org/

Contact: John Doe <trustedbsd-audit@trustedbsd.org\ >

Currently, we are exploring a variety of strategies to learn about the
implementation and performance issues in order to have a solid design.
One of our main goals will be to use a standardized interface to the
system, whether it be POSIX.1e, or another of the other standards,
because as they say "Standards are great because you have so many to
choose from." Hopefully within the next month or so, we will populate
the perforce TrustedBSD tree with an agreed upon framework that is ready
for serious final work.

--------------

TrustedBSD Project
------------------

URL: http://www.TrustedBSD.org/

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org\ >

The TrustedBSD Project continued focusing development efforts on
fine-grained Capabilities and Mandatory Access Control this month.
Kernel support for capabilities is essentially complete, and efforts are
underway to adapt userland applications to use Capabilities. The login
process has been updated to allow users to run with additional privilege
based on /etc/capabilities. The MAC implementation work has also been
active, with improved support for the labeling of IPC objects, including
better integration into the network stack. Both development trees have
been updated to work with recent KSE-related developments, as well as
exist more happily in a fine-grained SMP kernel. Initial audit-related
work appears in a separate entry.

Development of TrustedBSD source code was moved to the FreeBSD Perforce
repository, permitting better source code management. As such, the
TrustedBSD development trees will now be available via cvsup.

--------------

UDF Filesystem
--------------

URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~scottl/udf

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org\ >

Modest gains have been made on the UDF filesystem since the last report.
Reading of files from DVD-ROM now works (and is fast, according to some
reports), and there is preliminary support for reading from CD-RW media.
The CD-RW support has only been tested against CD's created with
Adaptec/ Roxio DirectCD, and much, much more testing is needed. Once
this support is solid, I plan to check it into the tree and start work
on making the filesystem writable.

--------------

Web site conversion to XML
--------------------------

Contact: Nik Clayton <nik@FreeBSD.org\ >

Work is (slowly) progressing on converting the web site to use pages
marked up in a simple XML schema, and then generating HTML and other
output formats using XSLT style sheets. The work so far can be tested by
doing "cvs checkout -r XML\_XSL\_XP www" and then "cd www/en; make
index.html". Take a look at index.page in the same directory to see the
source XML. The CVS logs for index.page contain detailed instructions
explaining how index.page was generated from its earlier form.
