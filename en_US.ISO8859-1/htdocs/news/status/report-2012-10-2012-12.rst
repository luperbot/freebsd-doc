BHyVe
-----

| URL: https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/BHyVe
|  URL: http://www.bhyve.org/

| Contact: Neel Natu <neel@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Peter Grehan <grehan@FreeBSD.org\ >

BHyVe is a type-2 hypervisor for FreeBSD/amd64 hosts with Intel VT-x and
EPT CPU support. The bhyve project branch was merged into CURRENT on Jan
18. Work is progressing on performance, ease of use, AMD SVM support,
and being able to run non-FreeBSD operating systems.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. 1. Booting Linux/\*BSD/Windows
#. 2. Moving the codebase to a more modular design consisting of a small
   base and loadable modules
#. 3. Various hypervisor features such as suspend/resume/live
   migration/sparse disk support

--------------

Native iSCSI Target
-------------------

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierała <trasz@FreeBSD.org\ >

During the October-December time period, the Native iSCSI Target project
progressed to the working prototype stage. Most of this time was spent
writing kernel-based part, an iSCSI frontend to the CAM Target Layer.
The frontend handles iSCSI Full Feature phase after ctld(8) hands off
the connection. The istgt-derived code in ctld(8) was rewritten from
scratch; now it's much shorter and more readable. The ctladm(8) utility
gained iSCSI-specific subcommands to handle tasks such as listing iSCSI
sessions or forcing disconnection. The target works correctly with the
FreeBSD initiator.

--------------

NFS Version 4
-------------

Contact: Rick Macklem <rmacklem@FreeBSD.org\ >

The NFSv4.1 client, including support for pNFS for the Files Layout
only, has now been committed to head/current. Work on NFSv4.1 server
support has just been started and will hopefully be ready for
head/current this summer. The client side disk caching of delegated
files is progressing and the code is under projects/nfsv4-packrats in
the subversion repository. Someone is working on server side referrals
and, as such, I hope this might make it into 10.0 as well.

--------------

pxe\_http -- booting FreeBSD from apache
----------------------------------------

URL: http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/base/user/sbruno/pxe_http_head/

Contact: Sean Bruno <sbruno@FreeBSD.org\ >

Currently works with VirtualBox VMs and Apache 2.2 port.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Lots and lots of compile warnings exist with clang and gcc. This
   really needs to be investigated.
#. Better support for other webservers. Currently needs Apache to work.
#. Needs another pass at basic documentation. Current documentation is
   actually quite good from the original
#. Network stack needs audit. I'm not sure if the HTTP/TCP/UDP/IP code
   is original or based on something else.

--------------

UEFI
----

| URL: https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/UEFI
|  URL: http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/base/projects/uefi/

Contact: Benno Rice <benno@FreeBSD.org\ >

There is code in the projects/uefi branch that can build a working
64-bit loader for UEFI. This loader can load a kernel and boot to a
mountroot prompt on a serial console on a system with ≤ 1GB of RAM. Full
multiuser has not yet been tested. Work is progressing towards having a
working syscons. The issue preventing boot on systems with > 1GB of RAM
has not yet been found. UEFI-compatible boot media can be generated
using in-tree tools, however there are issues with detecting the CD
filesystem and using it as the load default. The 64-bit UEFI loader can
load a 32-bit kernel but currently cannot hand over to it due to a lack
of code to switch to 32-bit mode. Further research is required into
Secure Boot.

--------------

Unprivileged install and image creation
---------------------------------------

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >

In order to make it easier to build releases and embedded system disk
images I have been adding infrastructure to allow the install and
packaging stages to the FreeBSD build progress to run without root
privilege. To this end I have added two options to the toplevel build
system: The ``-DDB_FROM_SRC`` option allows the install to proceed when
the required set of passwd and group entires does not match the host
system. The ``-DNO_ROOT`` option causes files to be installed as the
running user and for metadata such as owner, group, suid bits, and file
flags to be logged in a ``${DESTDIR}/METALOG`` file.

This work required the import of NetBSD's ``mtree`` and the addition of
a number of features from NetBSD to ``install``. I have added all
FreeBSD features to NetBSD's ``mtree`` and imported it as ``nmtree``.
Before FreeBSD 10.0 is released I will replace our version. I have also
added all required features to ``install``. Changes to ``makefs`` were
required to parse the contents of the ``METALOG`` file.

These new features required importing new versions of the pwcache(3) and
vis(3) APIs from NetBSD so those portions of libc.

In addition to modifying build infrastructure to use the new features of
``mtree`` and ``install``. I corrected a number of cases of files being
installed by programs other than ``install`` or being installed more
than once. A few known instances of duplicate directories in the output
exist, but the results are usable in some contexts.

I plan to MFC these changes as far back as the stable/8 branch to make
it possible to build all supported releases without root privilege.

This work was sponsored by DARPA and AFRL.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Add support for ``-DNO_ROOT`` to ``src/release/Makefile`` so that
   releases can be built without root privilege.
#. Create a tool to install partition tables and file system images in
   disk image files without the use of ``mdctl``, ``gpart``, and ``dd``.

--------------

BSD-licenced patch(1)
---------------------

URL: http://code.google.com/p/bsd-patch/

| Contact: Pedro Giffuni <pfg@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Gabor Kovesdan <gabor@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Xin Li <delphij@FreeBSD.org\ >

FreeBSD has been using for a while a very old version of GNU patch that
is partially under the GPLv2. The original GNU patch utility is based on
an initial implementation by Larry Wall that was not actually copyleft.
OpenBSD did many enhancements to an older non-copyleft version of patch,
this version was later adopted and further refined by DragonFlyBSD and
NetBSD but there was no centralized development of the tool and FreeBSD
kept working independently. In less than a week we took the version in
DragonFlyBSD and adapted the FreeBSD enhancements to make it behave
nearer to the version used natively in FreeBSD. Most of the work was
done by Pedro Giffuni, adapting patches from sepotvin@ and ed@, and
additional contributions were done by Christoph Mallon, Gabor Kovesdan
and Xin Li. As a result of this we now have a new version of patch
committed in head/usr.bin/patch that you can try by using
WITH\_BSD\_PATCH in your builds. The new patch(1) doesn't support the
FreeBSD-specific -I and -S options which don't seem necessary. In GNU
patch -I actually means 'ignore whitespaces' and we now support it too.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Testing. A lot more testing.

--------------

bsdconfig(8)
------------

| URL: http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/base/head/usr.sbin/bsdconfig/
|  URL: http://freshports.org/sysutils/bsdconfig/
|  URL: http://druidbsd.sf.net/download/bsdconfig/

Contact: Devin Teske <dteske@FreeBSD.org\ >

bsdconfig(8) is actively being developed in HEAD under the
WITH\_BSDCONFIG build-requirement. Snapshots are occasionally taken and
made available through the ports system to make testing on 9.0-RELEASE
or higher easier on the testers. Currently HEAD is far beyond the
version 0.7.3 sitting in ports. Upcoming changes will push this to
version 0.8 bringing in the necessary frameworks required for in-depth
package management and distribution maintenance (read: one step closer
to full 1.0 release).

--------------

FreeBSD Core Team
-----------------

Contact: Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org\ >

In the fourth quarter, the Core Team granted access for 7 new
committers, and took 1 commit bit in for safekeeping.

The Core Team oversaw the response to the security incident in November
in cooperation with the security team, port managers, and cluster
administrators. For more information on the fallouts and response see
the `official
announcement <http://www.FreeBSD.org/news/2012-compromise.html>`__. As a
result, 9.1-RELEASE was delayed until late December and was released
with a limited set of binary packages. The Core Team continues to work
with developers to rebuild, review, and restore the package building
infrastructure along with redports/QAT.

--------------

FreeBSD Documentation Engineering
---------------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/internal/doceng.html

| Contact: Glen Barber <gjb@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Marc Fonvieille <blackend@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: G?bor K?vesd?n <gabor@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Hiroki Sato <hrs@FreeBSD.org\ >

The translations/, projects/ and user/ directories of the doc repository
have been opened with the announced policies in effect. These branches
are now actively used for translations work, editing the upcoming
printed version of the Handbook, and some doc infrastructure
improvements.

The next phase of the infrastructure improvements is in progress. It
will migrate to real XML tools (with the exception of Jade) for
validation and rendering. At the same time, the DocBook schema will be
updated to 4.5.

After long discussions, Google Analytics has been enabled on FreeBSD.org
webpages but access to statistical data has to be solicited from the
Documentation Engineering Team on an individual and one time basis.

Since July, we have added two doc committers and one translator.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Help the ongoing work on printed edition of the Handbook.
#. Finish the migration to XML tools.

--------------

FreeBSD Foundation
------------------

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org\ >

A strong year-end `fundraising
campaign <http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/announcements.shtml#fundraising>`__
led to the raising $770,000 in 2012. Thank you to everyone who made a
donation to support FreeBSD!

We published our `year-end
newsletter <http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/press/2012Dec-newsletter.shtml>`__
that highlighted everything we did to support the FreeBSD Project and
community during the second half of the year.

We were a Gold Sponsor for EuroBSDCon. We also attended the conference
and developer summit. Erwin Lansing organized and chaired the Ports and
Package Summit and Vendor Summit at EuroBSDCon 2012. We attended MeetBSD
developer summit November 2012.

George Neville-Neil organized and the Foundation sponsored the Bay Area
Vendor Summit November 2012. We were represented at LISA.

Kirk McKusick taught a tutorial and gave a keynote at EuroBSDCon 2012,
and Justin Gibbs gave a talk at ZFS Day, October 2012.

We talked to DNS server software vendors and participated in discussions
on our DNS implementation, specifically with regard to DNSSEC
validation, at CENTR Tech September 2012 (Amsterdam, the Netherlands)
and EuroBSDCon.

We visited companies to discuss their FreeBSD use and to help facilitate
collaboration with the Project.

Robert Watson published `ACM Queue and Communications of the ACM: A
decade of OS access-control
extensibility <http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2430732>`__ and Kirk
McKusick published `ACM Queue and Communications of the ACM: Disks from
the Perspective of a File
System <http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2367378>`__.

We negotiated/supervised Foundation funded projects: porting FreeBSD to
the Efika ARM platform, Capsicum Component Framework, Native iSCSI
Target implementation, and EUFI.

We negotiated/supervised/funded hardware needs in FreeBSD co-location
centers.

Many board members provided support for recovery efforts following the
security compromise of FreeBSD.org systems in late 2012.

We completed negotiation and provided legal counsel for the new website
privacy policy for the FreeBSD Project.

We are now an industrial partner in the Cambridge/Imperial/Edinburgh
EPSRC REMS project on the Rigorous Engineering of Mainstream Systems.

We coordinated the Foundation's discussion of Jira/Java; conclusion,
will continue to be supportive of OpenJDK and not restart proprietary
JDK support.

We implemented a donor management database to help with our fundraising
efforts. We also began working on automating the donation process.

We started the Faces of FreeBSD Series where we share the story of a
Foundation grant recipient periodically. This allows us to spotlight
people who received Foundation funding to work on development projects,
run conferences, travel to conferences, and advocate for FreeBSD.

We hired two technical staff members.

--------------

Postmaster
----------

Contact: David Wolfskill <postmaster@FreeBSD.org\ >

The postmaster team has expanded, with the addition of Florian Smeets
(flo@FreeBSD.org).

We have implemented a Mailman "handler" to drop duplicate messages when
both copies are sent to the same list (under both the "long" (e.g.,
"freebsd-current") and "short" (e.g., "current") names).

We have created several new mailing lists:

-  freebsd-course: educational course on FreeBSD
-  freebsd-numerics: Discussions of high quality implementation of libm
   functions.
-  freebsd-snapshots: FreeBSD Development Snapshot Announcements
-  freebsd-tcltk: FreeBSD-specific Tcl/Tk discussions

We have also removed old mailing lists:

-  freebsd-binup
-  freebsd-www (merged into freebsd-doc)

--------------

AMD GPUs kernel-modesetting support
-----------------------------------

| URL: https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/AMD_GPU
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~kib/misc/ttm.1.patch

| Contact: Alexander Kabaev <kan@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Jean-S?bastien P?dron <dumbbell@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org\ >

Jean-S?bastien P?dron started to port the AMD GPUs driver from Linux to
FreeBSD 10-CURRENT in January 2013. This work is based on a previous
effort by Alexander Kabaev. Konstantin Belousov provided the initial
port of the TTM memory manager.

As of this writing, the driver is building but the tested device fails
to attach.

Status updates will be posted to the FreeBSD wiki.

--------------

Common Flash Interface (CFI) driver improvements
------------------------------------------------

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >

The Common Flash Interface provides a common programming interface for a
wide range of NOR flash devices commonly found in embedded systems. I
have developed a number of improvements to the cfi(4) device when used
on Intel StrataFlash parts. Unnecessary erase cycles are now avoided,
devices that require single word writes only write changed words, and
multi-word writes are supported for Intel and Sharp devices.
Additionally the timeout code has been reworked and no longer imposes
unneeded latency on operations taking less than 100us. With all of these
changes streaming write speed has improved by more than an order of
magnitude. Once these changes are reviewed they will be committed to
HEAD.

This work was sponsored by DARPA and AFRL.

--------------

SMP-Friendly pf(4)
------------------

Contact: Gleb Smirnoff <glebius@FreeBSD.org\ >

The project is aimed at moving the pf(4) packet filter out of a single
mutex, as well as in general improving of the FreeBSD port. The project
has reached its main goal. The pf(4) is no longer covered by single
mutex and contention on network stack on pf(4) is now very low. The code
is production ready. The projects/pf branch had been merged to the head
branch and will be available in 10.0-RELEASE.

--------------

Unmapped I/O
------------

URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~kib/misc/unmapped.13.patch

| Contact: Jeff Roberson <jeff@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org\ >

A well-known performance problem of FreeBSD on large SMP hardware is the
need to invalidate TLB for all CPUs when instantiating and destroying
the VMIO buffers. Invalidation is performed by sending inter-processor
interrupt broadcast, which disrupts the execution path of each CPU, and
induces latency on the request itself. Since most I/O requests
processing require creation of the buffers to hold the data in the
kernel, TLB invalidation becomes an obstacle for I/O scalability on
many-CPU machines.

The work done for flushing the TLBs is especially meaningless since most
mappings created are not used for anything but copying the data from the
usermode to the kernel page cache forth and back. Most architectures
have already established facilities to perform such copies using much
faster techniques, for instance, the direct map on amd64, or specially
reserved per-CPU page frames or TLB entries on other architectures.

Jeff Roberson unified the machine-specific parts of the busdma(9),
making a common set of low-level functions available on each
architecture. This was committed as r246713. The end result is that the
new types of the load functions can be added in the single,
machine-independent place. In particular, it is easy to modify the
drivers to accept the 'unmapped' bio requests, which lists the vm pages
for the device dma engine, instead of the virtual address of the kernel
buffer.

Konstantin Belousov developed the changes for buffer cache which allow
the VMIO buffers to not map the referenced pages, and used the feature
for UFS. Per-architecture pmap\_copy\_pages(9) methods were added to
facilitate fast copying between user I/O buffers and pages of unmapped
buffers. The unmapped buffers create the unmapped bio requests for the
drivers, support for which was made possible by Jeff's patch.

Tests show that even on a small 4-core machine, the system time for
reading files on UFS is reduced by 30%.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test the patch, in particular, on non-x86 architectures.

--------------

The FreeBSD Japanese Documentation Project
------------------------------------------

| URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/ja/
|  URL: http://www.jp.FreeBSD.org/doc-jp/

| Contact: Hiroki Sato <hrs@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Ryusuke Suzuki <ryusuke@FreeBSD.org\ >

The ja\_JP.eucJP subtree has constantly been updated since the last
status report.

In FreeBSD Handbook, translation work of the "users" section has been
completed. "linuxemu" and "serialcomms" were updated and subsection
"Subversion mirror site" was newly added to "mirrors" section.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Further translation work of outdated documents in the ``ja_JP.eucJP``
   subtree.

--------------

Compiler improvements for FreeBSD/ARMv6
---------------------------------------

Contact: Andrew Turner <andrew@FreeBSD.org\ >

FreeBSD/ARM architecture is now supported by the in-tree clang compiler.
ARM EABI support is now available for both clang and gcc along with the
older and less documented OABI. There are several outstanding issues,
once they are fixed EABI will be made default.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test EABI builds
#. Fix exception handling for EABI
#. Test clang builds
#. Get clang to work natively on EABI-based ARM system. Currently it
   works only as cross-compiler for ARM EABI.

--------------

FreeBSD on AARCH64
------------------

| URL: https://github.com/zxombie/aarch64-freebsd-sandbox
|  URL:
  http://www.arm.com/products/tools/models/fast-models/foundation-model.php

Contact: Andrew Turner <andrew@FreeBSD.org\ >

Work has started on porting FreeBSD to AARCH64, ARM's new 64-bit
architecture, using the ARMv8 Foundation Model software. GCC and
binutils have been ported to FreeBSD and work started on kernel
initialization, including MMU setup.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Get the MMU working
#. Get system register documentation from ARM
#. Port clang AArch64 to FreeBSD
#. Bring the code into a FreeBSD project branch

--------------

FreeBSD on BeagleBone
---------------------

| Contact: Tim Kientzle <kientzle@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Oleksandr Tymoshenko <gonzo@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Damjan Marion <dmarion@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Brett Wynkoop <wynkoop@wynn.com\ >

FreeBSD on BeagleBone is benefiting from the general work on ARM
stability being done by many people, and is proving to be a nice testbed
for our ARMv7 support. All ongoing work is happening now directly in
-CURRENT and we expect it to be in pretty good shape by the time 10.0
ships.

The network driver is now pretty stable; the system should be useful as
a small network device.

Occasional system snapshots are being built and advertised for people to
test. Ask on freebsd-arm@ if you'd like to try the newest one.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. We need someone to finish the USB driver. Ask if you'd like to take
   this over.
#. MMCSD performance is still rather poor.
#. There's been discussion of how to improve the GPIO configuration and
   pinmux handling to simplify hardware experimentation. If we had more
   people to help build drivers, we could start supporting some of the
   BeagleBone capes.
#. Mostly we just need people to use it and report any issues they
   encounter.

FreeBSD on Raspberry Pi
-----------------------

Contact: Oleksandr Tymoshenko <gonzo@FreeBSD.org\ >

FreeBSD is running on Raspberry Pi and supports the following
peripherals:

-  USB controller
-  SDHC controller
-  Network
-  Framebuffer (HDMI and composite)
-  GPIO
-  VCHI interface

Videocore tests (OpenGL, video decoding, audio, display access) work
with current VCHI driver implementation.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Add DMA mode support to USB driver. Some proof-of-concept code is
   done but more work required to finish it.
#. Re-implement VCHI driver with more FreeBSD-friendly locking.
#. Implement more drivers: SPI, PWM, audio.

We are proud to announce that the FreeBSD Haskell Team has updated the
Haskell Platform to 2012.4.0.0, GHC to 7.4.2 as well as updated existing
ports to their latest stable versions. All Haskell ports are also
updated to use new OPTIONS framework, and now, building with dynamic
libraries (DYNAMIC) is on by default. GHC also uses GCC 4.6 and binutils
2.22 from ports. We also added a number of new Haskell ports, and their
count in FreeBSD Ports tree is now 368.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test GHC to work with clang/LLVM.
#. Commit pending Haskell ports to the FreeBSD Ports tree.
#. Add more ports to the Ports Collection.

The ports tree crossed the threshold of 24,000 ports, while the PR count
still is close to 1600.

In Q4 we added five new committers and took in two commit bits for safe
keeping.

In the tradition of recruiting new portmgr@ at conferences, we added
Bernhard Froehlich to our ranks. He is the one responsible for
redports.org

Pav Lucistnik stepped down from his role on portmgr, he was one of our
principles doing -exp runs and well known for sending failmails.

In the well publicised compromise, the pointyhat machines were broken
into and subsequently taken down, isolated and sanitised. As a
pre-emptive move redports/QAT were also taken down. Work is under way to
restore the services.

Mark Linimon began a from-scratch test install on one of his own spare
machines with the purpose of documenting all the missing steps from the
portbuild article. While doing so, he further overhauled the codebase to
both make it easier to install, and to further refactor it in light of a
security review (still ongoing at time of this writing). Once this is
complete, the next task will be to reinstall all existing machines from
scratch.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Most ports PRs are assigned, we now need to focus on testing,
   committing and closing.

Contact: <xfce@FreeBSD.org\ >

A major update has been made to **Thunar** (file manager for the Xfce
Desktop Environment).

*1.6.x* series introduce lots of improvements, most noticeably is **tabs
support**, and the performance has been improved.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Try to fix HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) feature in Midori
   with Vala 0.12.1 (works fine with Vala ≥ 0.14.x)
#. Replace libxfce4gui (deprecated and not maintained by upstream) by
   libxfce4ui in order to enhance support for Xfce ≥ 4.10.
#. Test core and plugins (panel, Thunar) with GLib ≥ 4.32 (to replace
   deprecated and removed functions introduced since GLib 2.30).
#. Fix gtk-xfce-engine with Gtk+ ≥ 3.6.

The 11th European BSD Conference took place in Warsaw, Poland at the
Warsaw University of Technology with a large number of visitors. It
started up with two tracks of tutorials, featuring FreeNAS, pfSense,
DTrace, PF, development of NetBSD drivers, and an overall introduction
to the FreeBSD operating system given by Kirk McKusick. There we also
had opening and closing keynotes, supplemented with 22 talks on
different topics related to FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeNAS and
PC-BSD: BHyVe, configuration management with puppet, improvements in the
OpenBSD cryptographic framework, tuning ZFS, server load balancing in
DNS, running FreeBSD on embedded systems, e.g MIPS and ARM, and
challenges in identity management and authentication.

The conference also had a dedicated track presented by the attendees of
the FreeBSD developer summit and open to all, where one could learn more
about what is happening currently in the Project: results of Google
Summer of Code 2012, architectural changes in the FreeBSD documentation
tree, ILNP, advancements in package building and development of pkg(8),
and a status report on the USB stack.

FreeBSD Developer Summit, Warsaw
--------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/201210DevSummit

Contact: Gabor Pali <pgj@FreeBSD.org\ >

We had 53 FreeBSD developers and invited guests attending the FreeBSD
Developer Summit organized as part of EuroBSDcon 2012 in Warsaw, Poland
at the Warsaw University of Technology. This year EuroBSDcon organizers
again offered us their generous support in helping with keeping the
event running smooth, helping with registrations, renting the venue, and
providing food for keeping attendees satisfied and happy.

The Warsaw developer summit spanned over 3 days and had 9 working groups
on various topics. We improved last year's layout inherited from the
Canadian summits because it has worked well earlier but could use some
further refinements. On both the first and second days, we ran the
working groups, ranging from the standard matters, discussing issues
with the USB stack, the compiler toolchain, the Ports Collection, or the
documentation to some experimental ones, e.g. arranging an operating
systems course focusing on FreeBSD. In addition to this, similarly to
last year, one of the working groups was about gathering vendors to
present their ideas and engage in discussion with the developers on
their needs from the Project. Finally, on the third day, there were a
number of exciting work-in-progress reports given in a dedicated
Developer Summit track at the main conference.

Photos and slides for the most of the talks are available on the home
page of the summit.
