Introduction
============

This report covers FreeBSD related projects between October and December
2009. This is the last of the four reports covering 2009, which has
shown to be a very important year for the FreeBSD Project. Besides other
notable things, a new major version of FreeBSD, 8.0-RELEASE, has been
released, while the release process for 7.3-RELEASE is soon to begin.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
reading. Let us also take this opportunity to wish you all a happy and
successful new year for 2010.

Please note that the deadline for submissions covering the period
between January and March 2010 is April 15th, 2010.

BSD-licensed iconv
------------------

URL:
http://p4db.FreeBSD.org/depotTreeBrowser.cgi?FSPC=//depot/projects/soc2009/gabor_iconv

Contact: G?bor K?vesd?n <gabor@FreeBSD.org\ >

Good compatibility has been ensured and there are only few pending items
that have to be reviewed/enhanced. Recently, an enhancement has been
completed, which makes it possible to accomplish better transliteration,
just like in the GNU version. An initial testing patch is expected at
the beginning of February.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Enhance conversion tables to make use of enhanced transliteration.
#. A performance optimization might be done later.

--------------

3G USB support
--------------

Contact: Andrew Thompson <thompsa@FreeBSD.org\ >

Recently, a bunch of new device IDs have been added for the u3g(4)
cellular wireless driver; the list should be comparable now with other
operating systems around. A lot of these devices have a feature where
the unit first attaches as a disk or CD-ROM that contains the Win/Mac
drivers. This state should be detected by the u3g driver and the usb
device is sent a command to switch to modem mode. This has been working
for quite some time but as it is implemented differently for each vendor
I am looking for feedback on any units where the auto switchover is not
working (or the init is not recognized at all). Please ensure you are
running an up to date kernel, like r201681 or later from 9.0-CURRENT, or
8-STABLE after the future merge of this revision.

--------------

Clang replacing GCC in the base system
--------------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/BuildingFreeBSDWithClang

| Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Pawel Worach <pawel.worach@gmail.com\ >

We are again able to build bootable i386/amd64 kernel. Nathan Whitehorn
committed a fix to FreeBSD, which enabled LLVM/clang to work mostly fine
on PowerPC. There is some preliminary testing of LLVM/clang on ARM and
MIPS being done. We have some ideas about sparc64 support which are
currently being investigated. You are welcome to contact us if you want
to help.

Since the last report, a lot has happened mostly in the area of C++;
clang is currently able to build working groff, gperf and devd, i.e. all
of the C++ apps we have in base. Unfortunately, it still cannot build
any of the C++ libraries — two of them are missing builtins and
libstdc++ is broken for other reasons.

Not much happened in the clangbsd branch as we cannot upgrade the
clang/llvm there because we are blocked by a bug that requires using
newer assembler than we can ship. This might be solved by either fixing
this (short term) or using llvm-mc instead of GNU as for assembling
(longer term).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Help with ARM/MIPS/sparc64.
#. More testing of clang on 3rd party apps (ports).
#. Discussion on integrating LLVM/clang into FreeBSD.

--------------

FreeBSD TDM Framework
---------------------

| Contact: Rafal Czubak <rcz@semihalf.com\ >
|  Contact: Michal Hajduk <mih@semihalf.com\ >

Important changes regarding FreeBSD TDM Framework since the last status
report:

-  Fully functional TDM controller driver for Marvell Kirkwood and
   Discovery SoCs.
-  Working voiceband channel character device driver.
-  Working Si3215, Si3050 codec drivers on corresponding FXS, FXO ports.
-  Demo application, which is capable of manipulating voiceband channel
   and codec state, starting/stopping channel transfers and echoing on
   single channel.
-  Preliminary version of driver bridging the voiceband infrastructure
   with Zaptel/DAHDI.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Improve various issues regarding working drivers and demo
   application.
#. Test Si3050 codec driver operation with PSTN.
#. Fully integrate voiceband infrastructure with Zaptel/DAHDI telephony
   hardware drivers.

--------------

HAST — Highly Available Storage
-------------------------------

URL:
http://lists.FreeBSD.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2009-October/001279.html

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org\ >

HAST software will provide synchronous replication of any GEOM provider
(eg. disk, partition, mirror, etc.) or file from one FreeBSD machine
(primary node) to another one (secondary node).

Because data is replicated at the block level neither applications, nor
file systems have to be modified to take advantage of this
functionality.

The functionality that HAST software will provide is very similar to the
functionality provided by the DRBD project for Linux.

The HAST project is sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.

Work is progressing well; first milestone was reached in December 2009
and the expected project completion date is January 31, 2010.

Check out FreeBSD mailing lists for patches to test in February and wish
me good luck!

And by the way, do not forget to donate to the FreeBSD Foundation, as
your donations make projects like this possible.

Thank you!

--------------

Intel XScale hwpmc(9) support
-----------------------------

Contact: Rui Paulo <rpaulo@FreeBSD.org\ >

Preliminary Hardware Performance Counter support for Intel XScale ARM
processors was committed to FreeBSD 9.0-CURRENT in December. This adds
another supported architecture to hwpmc(9). The system works for basic
performance counter usage but more advanced usage scenarios, namely
callchain support, are not yet implemented.

--------------

POSIX utmpx for FreeBSD
-----------------------

| URL:
  http://lists.FreeBSD.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2010-January/014893.html
|  URL:
  http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/endutxent.html
|  URL:
  http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/lib/libc/gen/utmpx.c
|  URL:
  http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/lib/libc/port/gen/getutx.c

Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@FreeBSD.org\ >

On January 13, I removed the utmp user accounting database and replaced
it with a new POSIX utmpx implementation. Unfortunately, the upgrade
path is a bit complex, because the utmp interface provided almost no
library interface to interact with the database files.

This change may have caused some regressions. Some ports may fail to
build, while there could also be bugs in the library functions.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Get a list of broken ports.
#. Fix them to comply to standards.
#. Send patches upstream.

--------------

SUJ — Journaled SoftUpdates
---------------------------

URL: http://jeffr_tech.livejournal.com/

Contact: Jeff Roberson <jeff@FreeBSD.org\ >

I have been adding a small intent log to SoftUpdates to eliminate the
requirement for fsck after an unclean shutdown. This work has been
funded by Yahoo!, iXsystems, and Juniper. Kirk McKusick has been aiding
me with design critiques and helping me better understand SoftUpdates.

Extensive testing by myself and Peter Holm has yielded a stable patch.
Current users are encouraged to follow the instructions posted to the
current@FreeBSD.org mailing list to verify stability in your own
workloads. Updates are forthcoming and it is expected to be merged to
9.0-CURRENT before the end of January. Ports to older versions of
FreeBSD will be available in SVN under alternate branches. Official
backports will be decided by re@ when 9.0-CURRENT is stable.

The changes are fully backwards and forwards compatible as there are
very few metadata changes to the filesystem. The journal may be enabled
or disabled on existing FFS filesystems using tunefs(8). The log
consumes 64 MB of space at maximum and fsck time is bounded by the size
of the log rather than the size of the filesystem. Other details are
available in my technical journal.

--------------

The webcamd deamon
------------------

URL: http://www.selasky.org/hans_petter/video4bsd/

Contact: Hans Petter Selasky <hselasky@FreeBSD.org\ >

The webcamd daemon enables hundreds of different USB based webcam
devices to be used under the FreeBSD-8/9 operating system. The webcam
daemon is basically an application, which is a port of Video4Linux USB
webcam drivers into userspace on FreeBSD. The daemon currently depends
on libc, pthreads, libusb and the VIDEO4BSD kernel module.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Add support for the remaining Video4Linux USB devices.
#. Make patches for increased buffer sizes, due to higher latency in
   userspace. Especially for High Speed USB.

FreeBSD Bugbusting Team
-----------------------

| URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#gnats
|  URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/BugBusting
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/studies/prs/
|  URL:
  http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/studies/prs/recommended_prs.html
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/recommended_subscribers.txt

| Contact: Gavin Atkinson <gavin@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Remko Lodder <remko@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Volker Werth <vwe@FreeBSD.org\ >

Bugmeister Gavin Atkinson has now been granted a src commit bit, and is
now starting to work through some of our backlog.

The list of PRs recommended for committer evaluation by the Bugbusting
Team continues to receive new additions; however, it has not yet
achieved high visibility. (This list contains PRs, mostly with patches,
that the Bugbusting Team consider potentially ready to be committed
as-is, or are probably trivially resolved in the hands of a committer
with knowledge of the particular subsystem.) One of the suggestions at
the Cambridge devsummit was to create a way for people to be emailed the
weekly summary that is posted to freebsd-bugs@, and this has now been
implemented. Please email linimon@FreeBSD.org to ask to be added to the
recommended\_subscribers.txt file (see above).

We continue to classify PRs as they arrive, adding 'tags' to the subject
lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem involved, or man page
references for userland PRs. These tags, in turn, produce lists of PRs
sorted both by tag and by manpage. At this point most of the PRs that
refer to supported versions of FreeBSD have been converted, and we are
keeping up as new ones come in. We hope that this is making it easier to
browse the PR database.

The overall PR count jumped to over 6,200 during the 8.0-RELEASE release
cycle but seems to have stabilized at around 6,100. As in the past, we
have a fairly good clearance rate for ports PRs but much less so for
other PRs. (Partly this is due to the concept of individual ports having
'maintainers'.)

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs
   that the team has already analyzed.

--------------

FreeBSD Release Engineering
---------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Contact: Release Engineering Team <re@FreeBSD.org\ >

The Release Engineering Team announced FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE on November
26th, 2009. With 8.0-RELEASE completed planning has begun for
7.3-RELEASE. The schedule has been set with the release date planned for
early March 2010.

The Release Engineering Team would like to thank George Neville-Neil
(gnn@) for his service on the team. George continues to work with the
FreeBSD Project but has stepped down from the Release Engineering Team
to focus on other activities.

The FreeBSD Foundation Status Report
------------------------------------

| URL: http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/
|  URL: https://twitter.com/freebsdfndation

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org\ >

Despite a difficult economy, we more than doubled our number of donors,
we raised $269K towards our goal of $300K, and with an improved economy
hope to surpass that this year.

We have funded two new projects. One is the Flattened Device Tree by
Rafal Jaworowski. And, the second one is Highly Available Storage by
Pawel Jakub Dawidek. We continued supporting the New Console Driver by
Ed Schouten and Improvements to the FreeBSD TCP Stack by Lawrence
Stewart. We also purchased equipment for several projects.

We have big plans for the new year! We are going to significantly
increase our project development and equipment spending. Stay tuned for
a project proposal submission announcement soon. We just announced that
we are accepting travel grant applications for AsiaBSDCon and will be
accepting them soon for BSDCan. And, we are working on infrastructure
projects to beef up hardware for package-building, network-testing, etc.

Read more about how we supported the project and community by reading
our end-of-year newsletter available at
http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/press/2009Dec-newsletter.shtml.

We are fund-raising for 2010 now! Find out more at

--------------

bwn(4) — Broadcom Wireless driver
---------------------------------

URL:
http://p4db.FreeBSD.org/depotTreeBrowser.cgi?FSPC=//depot/user/weongyo/wireless/src/sys/dev/bwn&HIDEDEL=NO

Contact: Weongyo Jeong <weongyo@FreeBSD.org\ >

bwn(4) is replacing bwi(4) driver for to the following reasons:

-  Uses latest v4 firmware image instead of using the much older v3
   firmware. In this way, we have some great benefits, such as support
   for N-PHYs and the fixes of various earlier firmware bugs.
-  Supports PIO mode. This is important because — as you might know —
   the Broadcom Wireless Driver is created by reverse-engineering so
   some pieces of hardware might not work with DMA operations.
-  Supports 64 bit DMA operations.
-  Separates bwi(4) driver into two parts; siba(4) driver and bwn(4)
   driver. Many Broadcom wireless and NIC devices are based on Silicon
   Sonics Backplane, such as bwi(4), which implemented the SIBA
   operations internally. This resulted in code duplication as other
   drivers had to implement their own routines to deal with SIBA. In the
   case of bwn(4), these two parts have been separated and implemented
   in their own kernel modules to avoid this problem and help further
   development by providing a standalone siba(4) driver.

Currently, it is tested on big/little endian machines and 32/64-bit DMA
operation with STA mode. A major patch for siba(4) is being reviewed
before committing into 9.0-CURRENT.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. MESH/IBSS/HOSTAP mode is not supported.
#. LP/N PHYs are not supported.

--------------

IP Payload Compression Protocol support
---------------------------------------

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org\ >

One of the longer outstanding feature problems with the FreeBSD IP
security stack, broken IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPcomp) support,
has been fixed.

While working on the fix, various problems had been identified:

-  Problems with the IPcomp packet handling in IPsec.
-  opencrypto compression handling and deflate implementation
   limitations. These were debugged using DTrace SDT probes.
-  Problems due to an outdated version of zlib used in some parts of the
   network stack and by the opencrypto framework.

Patches for all but the zlib support have been committed to 9.0-RELEASE
and merged to all supported stable branches including 6-STABLE. Special
thanks to Eugene Grosbein for helping with testing.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Fix ng\_deflate so that we can make use of Kip Macy's work on an
   up-to-date unified zlib version in the kernel, which would also fix
   the last occasional IPcomp hiccups.

--------------

Ralink wireless RT2700U/2800U/3000U run(4) USB driver
-----------------------------------------------------

URL: http://forums.FreeBSD.org/showthread.php?t=7562

Contact: Akinori Furukoshi <moonlightakkiy@yahoo.ca\ >

The run(4) driver brings support for Ralink RT2700U/2800U/3000U USB
wireless devices. For detailed information and list of all the supported
devices, please see the above mentioned URL. The source code has been
imported to the USB P4 repository on January 10, 2010 (172906).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Solve USB\_TIMEOUT problem when sending beacons, and/or confirm which
   chipsets supports AP mode if all of them do not support it.
#. Read TX stats for AMRR on AP mode, and/or confirm which chipsets
   supports AP mode if all of them do not support it.
#. Maintain the code.

--------------

Syncing pf(4) with OpenBSD 4.5
------------------------------

| URL: http://svn.FreeBSD.org/viewvc/base/user/eri/pf45/
|  URL: http://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/user/eri/pf45/head/

Contact: Ermal Lu??i <eri@FreeBSD.org\ >

This import is based on OpenBSD 4.5 state of pf(4). It includes many
improvements over the code currently present in FreeBSD. The actual new
feature present in pf45 repository is support for divert(4), which
should allow tools like snort\_inline to work with pf(4) too.

Currently, the pf(4) import is considered stable with normal kernel, as
well as VIMAGE enabled kernels.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. pflow(4)/pflog(4)/pfsync(4) need to be made VIMAGE aware.
#. More regression testing is needed.

--------------

Wireless mesh networking
------------------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/WifiMesh

Contact: Rui Paulo <rpaulo@FreeBSD.org\ >

Development of the FreeBSD 802.11s stack continues. The code in FreeBSD
HEAD has been updated to comply with draft 4.0. Merge to FreeBSD
8-STABLE will be done soon.

The developer is looking for funding to be able to implement mesh link
security algorithms and/or coordinated channel access (performance
improvement).

--------------

CAM-based ATA implementation
----------------------------

| Contact: Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org\ >

Existing ata(4) infrastructure, which has been around many years, has
various problems and limitations when compared to modern
controllers/device support. Although the CAM subsystem (used for SCSI)
is almost as old as ata(4), it is more eligible to solve the current
problems. To reduce code duplication and better support border cases
such as ATAPI and SAS, we have started to develop a new CAM based ATA
implementation.

As such, CAM infrastructure has been extended to support different
transports. New transport has been implemented to support PATA/SATA
buses. To support ATA disks, a new CAM driver (ada) has been written.
ATAPI devices are supported by existing SCSI drivers cd, da, sa, etc. To
support SATA port-multipliers another new CAM driver (pmp) has been
written. To support most featured and widespread SATA controllers, new
drivers ahci(4) and siis(4) have been developed.

To support legacy ATA controllers, a kernel option ATA\_CAM has been
added. When used, it makes all ata(4) controllers directly available to
CAM, deprecating ata(4) peripheral drivers and external APIs. To make
this possible, ata(4) code has been heavily refactored, making
controller driver API stricter.

Command queuing support gives new ATA implementation up to double
performance benefit on some workloads, with 20-30% improvement quite
usual.

SATA Port Multiplier support makes it easy to build fast and cheap
storage with huge capacities, by using dozens of SATA drives in one
system or external enclosures,

Some of that code has been presented in the recently released FreeBSD
8.0-RELEASE but 8-STABLE now includes a much improved version.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Improve timeout and transport error recovery.
#. Improve hot-plug support.
#. Find and fix any show stoppers for legacy ata(4) deprecation.
#. Write a new, more featured driver for Marvell SATA controllers
   (specifications desired).
#. Write SAS-specific transport and drivers for SAS HBAs (specifications
   desired). SAS controllers can support SATA devices and multipliers,
   so it should fit nicely into the new infrastructure.

Group Limit Increase
--------------------

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >

Historically, FreeBSD has limited the number of supplemental groups per
process to 15 (NGROUPS\_MAX was incorrectly declared to be 16). In
FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE we raised the limit to 1023, which should be
sufficient for most users and will be acceptably efficient for
incorrectly written applications that statically allocate NGROUPS\_MAX +
1 entries.

Because some systems such as Linux 2.6 support a larger group limit, we
have further relaxed this restriction in 9.0-CURRENT and made
kern.ngroups a tunable value, which supports values between 1023 and
INT\_MAX - 1. We plan to merge this to 8-STABLE before 8.1-RELEASE.

--------------

NFSv4 ACL support
-----------------

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org\ >

Native NFSv4 ACL support in ZFS and UFS has been committed into
9.0-CURRENT. It is expected to be MFCed in order to make it into FreeBSD
8.1-RELEASE.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Support for NFSv4 ACLs in tar(1).
#. MFC.

V4L support in Linux emulator
-----------------------------

URL: http://opal.com/freebsd/sys/compat/linux/

Contact: J.R. Oldroyd <fbsd@opal.com\ >

V4L video support in the Linux emulator is now available.

This work allows Linux applications using V4L video calls to work with
existing FreeBSD video drivers that provide V4L interfaces. It is tested
and working with the net/skype port and also with browser-based Flash
applications that access webcams. An early version has been committed to
9.0-CURRENT and work is in progress to commit the latest version and
then MFC. It is also tested on FreeBSD-8.0/amd64 and FreeBSD-7.2/i386.

Note: to be clear, this does not add V4L support to all webcams. The
FreeBSD camera driver must already offer V4L support itself in order for
a Linux application to be able to use that camera. The multimedia/pwcbsd
port provides the pwc(4) driver that already has V4L support. If your
camera is supported by a different driver, you will need to enhance that
driver to add V4L support.

Flattened Device Tree for embedded FreeBSD
------------------------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/FlattenedDeviceTree
|  URL:
  http://p4db.FreeBSD.org/changeList.cgi?FSPC=//depot/projects/fdt/...

Contact: Rafal Jaworowski <raj@semihalf.com\ >

The purpose of this project is to provide FreeBSD with support for the
Flattened Device Tree (FDT) technology, the mechanism for describing
computer hardware resources, which cannot be probed or self enumerated,
in a uniform and portable way. The primary consumers of this technology
are embedded FreeBSD platforms (ARM, AVR32, MIPS, PowerPC), where a lot
of designs are based on similar chips but have different assignment of
pins, memory layout, addresses bindings, interrupts routing and other
resources.

Current state highlights:

Environment, supported tools

-  Integrated device tree compiler (dtc) and libfdt into FreeBSD
   userspace, kernel and loader build

loader(8)

-  Full support for device tree blob handling
-  Load, traverse, modify (including add/remove) device tree nodes and
   properties
-  Pass the device tree blob to the kernel
-  Both ARM and PowerPC loader(8) supported

Kernel side FDT support (common)

-  Developed OF interface for FDT-backed platforms
-  ofw\_bus I/F (and /dev/openfirm) available with FDT
-  Integrated FDT resources representation with newbus (fdtbus and
   simplebus drivers)

PowerPC kernel (Freescale MPC85XX SOC)

-  MPC8555CDS and MPC8572DS successfully converted to FDT conventions

ARM kernel (Marvell Orion, Kirkwood and Discovery SOC)

-  Work in progress on integrating FDT infrastructure with ARM platform
   code

Work on this project has been sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Complete missing pieces for PowerPC (PCI bridge driver conversion to
   FDT).
#. Complete ARM support.
#. Merge to SVN.

--------------

FreeBSD/ia64
------------

Contact: Marcel Moolenaar <marcel@FreeBSD.org\ >

Work continues on our ia64 port. Many recent commits to help improve
stability have been made to 9.0-CURRENT and MFCed to 8-STABLE.

Due to interest from a very motivated user, package builds have been
restarted for ia64-8. This is primarily intended as a QA step to
discover and fix bugs on ia64, rather than to create packages for
upload.

Based on the above, Mark Linimon documented how to add more
architectures to the package cluster scheduler. (This work will also be
of use in an upcoming effort to start powerpc package builds.)

There are currently 3 ia64 machines online and building packages. The
machines seem stable as long as multiple simultaneous package builds are
not attempted, in which case they get machine checks. This is puzzling,
since other heavy workloads seem stable on the same machines.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Continue to try to understand why multiple simultaneous package
   builds bring the machines down.
#. Upgrade the firmware on the two machines at Yahoo! to see if that
   helps the problem.
#. Configure a fourth machine that has been made available to us.
#. Figure out the problems with the latest GCC port on ia64.
#. We can use some help with reviewing the ia64 platform pages and
   bringing them up-to-date.

FreeBSD/mips

| Contact: The FreeBSD/mips mailing list <mips@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org\ >

The base/projects/mips branch has been merged into 9.0-CURRENT. The
merge is complete and the sanity tests have passed. The code has booted
on both a Ubiquiti RouterStation (big endian) as well as in gxemul
(little endian).

The branch lived for one year, minus a day, and accumulated much work:

-  A new port to the Atheros AR71xx series of processors. This port
   supports the RouterStation and RouterStation PRO boards from
   Ubiquiti. Other boards should work with minimal tweaking. This port
   should be considered as nearing production quality, and has been used
   extensively by the developers. The primary author of this port is
   Oleksandr Tymoshenko (gonzo@FreeBSD.org).
-  A new port to the SiByte BCM1250 SoC on the BCM91250 evaluation board
   (aka SWARM). This port is reported to be stable, but this hardware is
   a little old and not widely available. The primary author of this
   port is Neel Natu (neel@FreeBSD.org). Only one core is presently
   supported.
-  A port, donated by Cavium, to their Octeon and Octeon plus series of
   SoC (CN3xxx and CN5xxx). This code is preliminary, supporting only a
   single core right now. It has been lightly tested on the CN3860
   evaluation board only in 32-bit mode. Warner Losh (imp@FreeBSD.org)
   has been driving the efforts to get this code into the tree.
-  A port, donated by RMI, to their XLR series of SoCs. This port is
   single core only, as well. The code reaches multi-user but should be
   considered beta quality for the moment. Randal Stewart
   (rrs@FreeBSD.org) has been driving the efforts to integrate this into
   the tree.
-  Preliminary support for building a mips64 kernel from this source
   base. More work is needed here, but at least two kernels successfully
   build in 64-bit mode (OCTEON1 and MALTA64).
-  Very early support for N32 and N64 ABIs
-  Support for booting compressed kernels has been added (gonzo@).
-  Improved support for debugging
-  Improved busdma and bus\_space support
-  Many bug fixes
-  More types of MIPS cores are recognized
-  Expanded cache handling for newer processors
-  Beginning of a port to the alchemy au1XXX cpus is present, but
   experimental.
-  Work on SMP is underway to support multicore processors like the
   SiByte, Octeon and XLR processors.

The development branch had been updated incorrectly several times over
the past year, and the damage was too much to repair. We have retired
the branch and will do further mips development in 9.0-CURRENT for the
time being. If you have a checked out tree, the suggested way to update
the projects/mips tree you have is to do a "svn switch
svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/head" in that tree.

I would like to thank everybody that has contributed time, code or
hardware to make FreeBSD/mips better.

As development proceeds, I will keep posting updates. In addition, I
hope to have some mini "how-to" wiki pages done for people that want to
try it out.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. We are still investigating how feasible merging all this work into
   8-STABLE will be, as it represents a huge leap forward in code
   stability and quality.

FreeBSD/sparc64
---------------

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org\ >

The main thing that has taken place since the last Status Report is that
I have gotten to the bottom of the remaining PCI problems with Sun Fire
V215/V245 and support for these has been completed and since r202023 now
is part of 9.0-CURRENT. With some luck it will also be part of the
upcoming 7.3-RELEASE.

Some other news:

-  Two bugs in the NFS server causing unaligned access and thus panics
   on sparc64 and all other architectures with strict alignment
   requirements (basically all Tier-2 ones) have been fixed. There
   likely will be a 8.0-RELEASE Erratum Notice released for these.
-  FreeBSD has been adopted to the changed firmware of newer Sun Fire
   V480 (those equipped with version 7 Schizo bridges) and has been
   reported to now run fine on these. The necessary change will be part
   of 7.3-RELEASE. Unfortunately, using the on-board NICs in older
   models of Sun Fire V480 (at least those equipped with version 4
   Schizo bridges) under FreeBSD still leads to the firmware issuing a
   FATAL RESET due to what appears to be a CPU bug, which needs to be
   worked around.
-  Work on supporting Sun Fire V1280 has been started but still is in
   very early stages. Unfortunately, these are rather quirky machines.
   After solving two firmware specialties the loader now is able to boot
   the kernel but the latter currently still fails in early cycles as
   trying to take the trap table over from the firmware results in a
   solid hang.

Chromium web browser

Contact: Ben Laurie <ben@links.org\ >

Chromium is a Webkit-based web browser that is largely BSD licensed. It
has been ported from Linux to FreeBSD in October and we have been
posting patches and test builds periodically since then. Chromium works
well on FreeBSD — it is very fast and stable but there are a handful of
rough edges that need to be polished up. Two remaining bugs should
probably be fixed before releasing a chromium-devel port. We are looking
for volunteers to test and maintain this port to make this BSD browser a
viable option on FreeBSD desktop systems.

Ports Collection

Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon@FreeBSD.org\ >

Most of the recent activity has been dealing with the 8.0-RELEASE
process. As an experiment, we have tried to decouple the ports QA
timeline as much as possible from the src QA timeline. Although this
meant that the impact on people actively maintaining and using ports has
been much less than in previous releases, it still has not solved the
problem of the release going out with a stale set of packages. We are
still trying to come up with a better solution for the problem.

The ports count is over 21,000. The PR count jumped to over 1,000 but is
now back to around 950.

We are currently building packages for amd64-6, amd64-7, amd64-8,
i386-6, i386-7, i386-8, i386-9, ia64-8, sparc64-7, and sparc64-8. This
represents the addition of i386-9 and ia64-8 since the last report.

There has been some discussion of when to drop regular package builds
for 6.X but no decision has been made yet. The cluster and the port
managers are struggling to keep up with so many branches being active
all at the same time.

Mark Linimon continues to make progress on the cluster nodes. Almost
every node that does not have a hard disk failure is now online. In
addition, he continues to make progress debugging problems that
occasionally take nodes offline.

The next task is to characterize the overall performance of the build
cluster. The question has been asked of us, "what would it take to speed
up package builds?" There is no one simple answer. It is not merely a
matter of having a larger number of package building machines, so before
asking for funding we first need to identify the current bottlenecks.
While we are starting to understand the problems on the nodes, the
problems on the dispatch machine itself are much harder. Complicating
the matter is that there are several periodic processes (ZFS backup, ZFS
expiration, and errorlog compression, among others) that can combine to
slow that machine significantly. The simultaneous interaction of all
these is proving difficult to quantify.

Between Pav Lucistnik and Martin Wilke, many more experimental ports
runs have been completed and committed.

We have added 3 new committers since the last report, and 1 older one
has rejoined us.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. We are still trying to set up ports tinderboxes that can be made
   available to committers for pre-testing.
#. Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR assigned to
   committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is helping to keep
   the backlog down, we are going to need to do more to get the ports in
   the shape they really need to be in.
#. Although we have added many maintainers, we still have more than
   4,700 unmaintained ports. (See, for instance, the list on portsmon.
   The percentage remains steady at just over 22%.) We are always
   looking for dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few unmaintained
   ports. As well, the packages on amd64 and especially sparc64 lag
   behind i386, and we need more testers for those.

VirtualBox 3.1.2 has been committed to the ports tree.

Several changes to the port have been performed with this update
including:

-  Port has been renamed to virtualbox-ose to reflect that we are now
   using the OSE version.
-  A separate port for the kernel modules has been created —
   virtualbox-ose-kmod.
-  A separate port for guest additions for FreeBSD guests has been
   created — virtualbox-ose-additions.
-  Proper FreeBSD support for PulseAudio has been added.
-  Procfs is not required anymore because vbox uses sysctl(3) now.
-  Juergen Lock's FreeBSD host networking patches have been added. They
   are now also in the upstream vbox SVN (modulo vbox variable naming
   style adjustments).
-  Allow direct tap networking again (for users that need the best
   network performance and/or need more complex network setups, like
   when they want to use routing instead of bridging to e.g. protect
   guests from messing with the lan's ARP tables; a tap + routing +
   proxy arp example is in the above freebsd-emulation@ posting.)
-  Enable vbox's shared MAC feature when using bridged mode on a Wifi
   interface, together with the virtualbox-ose-kmod change this should
   fix bridged mode for Wifi users.

We would like to say thanks to all the people that helped us by
reporting bugs and submitting fixes. We also thank the VirtualBox
developers for their help with the ongoing effort to port VirtualBox to
FreeBSD

Since the last report we have seen a growth of 2,000 users on our forums
resulting in approximately 10,000 registered users at this time. The
posts count is about to reach 60,000 soon, which are contained in almost
9,000 threads.

The sign-up rate still hovers between 50-100 each week. The total number
of visitors (including 'guests') is currently hard to gauge, but is
likely to be a substantial multiple of the registered userbase.

New topics and posts are actively 'pushed out' to search engines. This
in turn makes the forums show up in search results more and more often,
making it a valuable and very accessible source of information for the
FreeBSD community.

One of the contributing factors to the forums' success is their
'BSD-style' approach when it comes to administration and moderation. The
forums have a strong and unified identity and are very actively
moderated, spam-free, and with a core group of very active and helpful
members, dispensing many combined decades' worth of knowledge to
starting, intermediate and professional users of FreeBSD.

As 8.0-RELEASE is out, BSD bc/dc can be now committed to 9.0-CURRENT. We
are only waiting for an experimental package building to make sure there
are no regressions after this change. BSD grep is complete but it cannot
be integrated yet because of some regex library issues. We need first a
fast and modern regex library so that we can change to BSD grep. BSD
sort has few incomplete features and needs some performance review.

Open tasks:
