Introduction
============

This report covers FreeBSD related projects between April and September
2009. During that time a lot of work has been done on wide variety of
projects, including the Google Summer of Code projects. The BSDCan
conference was held in Ottawa, CA, in May. The EuroBSDCon conference was
held in Cambridge, UK, in September. Both events were very successful. A
new major version of FreeBSD, 8.0 is to be released soon. If you are
wondering what's new in this long-awaited release, read Ivan Voras'
excellent
`summary <http://ivoras.sharanet.org/freebsd/freebsd8.html>`__.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
the reading.

Please note that the next deadline for submissions covering reports
between October and December 2009 is January 15th, 2010.

2009 was The FreeBSD Project's fifth year of participation in the Google
Summer of Code. We had a total of 17 successful projects. Some GSoC code
will be shipping with FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE and others will be integrated
into future releases.

The FreeBSD GSoC admin team would like to thank Google and our students
and mentors of another great year!

BSD-licensed iconv (Summer of Code 2009)
----------------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/G%C3%A1borSoC2009

Contact: G?bor K?vesd?n <gabor@FreeBSD.org\ >

The code has been extracted from NetBSD and has been transformed into an
independent shared library. The basic encodings are well supported.
Almost all forward conversions (foo -> UTF-32) are compatible with GNU
but the reverse ones are not so accurate because of GNU's advanced
transliteration. Some extra encodings have also been added. There are
two modules, which segfault; they need some debugging. I can keep
working on this project as part of my BSc thesis, so I hope to be able
to solve the remaining issues. Improved GNU compatibility is also very
desired (extra command line options for iconv(1), iconvctl(), private
interfaces, etc.).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Fix segfaults in Big5 and HZ modules
#. Improve transliteration in reverse encodings
#. Improve GNU compatibility by implementing extra features
#. Verify POSIX compatibility
#. Verify GNU compatibility
#. Check performance

--------------

BSD-licensed text-processing tools (Summer of Code 2008)
--------------------------------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/G%C3%A1borSoC2008

Contact: G?bor K?vesd?n <gabor@FreeBSD.org\ >

This project was started as part of Google Summer of Code 2008 but there
is still a bit of work to complete some missing parts. The BSD-licensed
grep implementation is feature-complete and has a good level of GNU
compatibility. Our only current concern about the BSD-licensed version
is to improve its performance. The GNU variant is much more complex, has
about 8 KSLOC, while BSD grep is tiny, has only 1.5 KSLOC. GNU uses some
shortcuts and optimizations to speed-up calls to the regex library; that
is why it is significantly faster. My point of view is that such
optimizations must be implemented in the regex library, keeping the
dependent utilities clean and easy to read. BSD grep is so tiny that
there is hardly any optimization opportunity by simplifying the code, so
the regex library is the next important TODO. There is another issue
with the current regex library. It does not support some invalid regular
expressions, which work in GNU. We need to maintain compatibility, so we
cannot just drop this feature. Actually, BSD grep is linked to the GNU
regex library to maintain this feature but due to the lack of the
mentioned shortcuts, it is still slower than GNU. Anyway, if we can live
with this little performance hit until we get a modern regex library, I
think grep is ready to enter HEAD. As for the regex library, NetBSD's
result of the last SoC is worth taking a look.

The sort utility has been rewritten from scratch. The existing
BSD-licensed implementation could not deal with wide characters by
design. The new implementation is still lacking some features but is
quite complete. There is a performance issue, though. Sorting is a
typical algorithmic subject but I am not an algorithmic expert, so my
implementation is not completely optimal. Some help would be welcome
with this part.

The bc/dc utilities have been ported from OpenBSD. They pass OpenBSD's
and GNU's regression tests but they arrived too late to catch 8.X, so
they will go to HEAD after the release.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Improve sort's sorting and file merging algorithms
#. Complete missing features for sort
#. Get a modern regex library for FreeBSD

--------------

Ext2fs Status report (Summer of Code 2009)
------------------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/SOC2009AdityaSarawgi

Contact: Aditya Sarawgi <sarawgi.aditya@gmail.com\ >

FreeBSD's ext2fs had some parts under GPL. The aim of my project was to
rewrite those parts and free ext2fs from GPL. I have been successful in
rewriting the parts and NetBSD's ext2fs was a great help in this.
Certain critical parts under GPL were also removed due to which the
write performance suffered. I also implemented Orlov Block Allocator for
ext2fs. Currently I am planning to make ext2fs Multiprocessor Safe
(MPSAFE). My work resides in truncs\_ext2fs branch of Perforce.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Ext4 support for FreeBSD
#. Directory indexing for ext2fs
#. Journaling in ext2fs using gjournal

--------------

libnetstat(3) - networking statistics (Summer of Code 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/PGJSoc2009
|  URL:
  http://p4web.freebsd.org/@md=d&cd=//&c=McZ@//depot/projects/soc2009/pgj_libstat/?ac=83

Contact: G?bor P?li <pgj@FreeBSD.org\ >

The libnetstat(3) project provides a user-space library API to monitor
networking functions with the following benefits:

-  ABI-robust interface making use of accessor functions in order to
   divorce monitoring applications from kernel or user ABI changes.
-  Supports running 32-bit monitoring tools on top of a 64-bit kernel.
-  Improved consistency for both kvm(3) and sysctl(3) when retrieving
   information.

The supported abstractions are as follows:

-  Active sockets and socket buffers
-  Network interfaces and multicast interfaces
-  mbuf(9) statistics
-  bpf(4) statistics
-  Routing statistics, routing tables, multicast routing
-  Protocol-dependent statistics

There is a sample application, called nettop(8), which provides a simple
ncurses-based top(1)-like interface for monitoring active connections
and network buffer allocations via the library. A modified version of
netstat(1) has also been created to use libnetstat(3) as much as
possible.

--------------

pefs - stacked cryptographic filesystem (Summer of Code 2009)
-------------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://blogs.freebsdish.org/gleb/
|  URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/SOC2009GlebKurtsov

| Contact: Gleb Kurtsou <gk@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Stanislav Sedov <stas@FreeBSD.org\ >

Pefs is a kernel level filesystem for transparently encrypting files on
top of other filesystems (like zfs or ufs). It adds no extra information
into files (unlike others), doesn't require cipher block sized io
operations, supports per directory/file keys and key chaining, uses
unique per file tweak for encryption. Supported algorithms: AES,
Camellia, Salsa20. The code is ready for testing.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Implement encrypted name lookup/readir cache
#. Optimize sparse files handling and file resizing

--------------

BSD# Project
------------

| URL: http://code.google.com/p/bsd-sharp/
|  URL: http://www.mono-project.org/

Contact: Romain Tarti?re <romain@blogreen.org\ >

The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and
applications to the FreeBSD operating system.

During the past year, the BSD# Team continued to track the Mono
development and the lang/mono port have almost always been up-to-date
(we however had to skip mono-2.2 because of some regression issues in
this release). Most of our patches have been merged in the mono trunk
upstream, and should be included in the upcoming mono-2.6 release.

In the meantime, a few more .NET related ports have been updated or
added to the FreeBSD ports tree. These ports include:

-  www/xsp and www/mod\_mono that make it possible to use FreeBSD for
   hosting ASP.NET application;
-  lang/boo, a CLI-targeted programming language similar to Python;
-  lang/mono-basic, the Visual Basic .NET Framework for Mono;
-  devel/monodevelop, an Integrated Development Environment for .NET;
-  and much more...

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test mono ports and send feedback (we are especially interested in
   tests where NOPORTDOCS / WITH\_DEBUG is enabled).
#. Port the mono-debugger to FreeBSD.
#. Build a debug live-image of FreeBSD so that Mono hackers without a
   FreeBSD box can help us fixing bugs more efficiently.

--------------

Clang replacing GCC in the base system
--------------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/BuildingFreeBSDWithClang

| Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Pawel Worach <pawel.worach@gmail.com\ >

The clang@FreeBSD team presents the status of clang/LLVM being able to
compile FreeBSD system. The current status is:

-  i386 - kernel boots, world needs little hacks but works
-  amd64 - kernel boots, world needs little hacks but works
-  ppc - broken because of unknown RTLD bug
-  other - unknown

All other platforms are untested.

A lot has happened over the spring/summer: amd64 got proper
mcmodel=kernel support, compiler-rt has been introduced (paving the way
for libgcc replacement), we have run two experimental port builds to see
how clang does there. The C++ support is able to parse devd.cc without
warnings. We have got the kernel working with -O2. FreeBSD has been
promoted to be an officially supported plaform in LLVM. As a result of
all this work, many parts of FreeBSD that did not compile before now
build without problems.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. The "ClangBSD" branch of FreeBSD got a little stale and has not been
   updated for a while.
#. We also need to get some important fixes into LLVM to get libc
   compiling and some other smaller issues.
#. We can still appreciate more testers on minor platforms (mostly on
   ARM, PPC and MIPS, but testing on other platforms is also welcome).

--------------

FreeBSD TDM Framework
---------------------

| Contact: Rafal Czubak <rcz@semihalf.com\ >
|  Contact: Michal Hajduk <mih@semihalf.com\ >

This work's purpose is a generic and flexible framework for systems
equipped with Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) units, often found on
embedded telecom chips. The framework is designed to support various
controllers and many types of TDM channels e.g. voiceband, sound and
miscellaneous data channels. Currently, voiceband infrastructure is
being developed on Marvell RD-88F6281 reference board. It will serve as
an example of how to use the TDM framework for other channel types. The
direct objective of using TDM with voiceband channels is bringing a
FreeBSD based VoIP system, capable of bridging analog telephone world
with digital IP telephony. Together with third party VoIP software (e.g.
Asterisk), the design can serve as VoIP Private Branch Exchange (PBX).

Current state highlights:

-  TDM controller interface
-  TDM channel interface
-  TDM channel API for kernel modules
-  codec interface
-  voiceband channel character device driver
-  TDM controller driver for Marvell Kirkwood and Discovery SoCs
-  Si3215 SLIC driver
-  Si3050 DAA driver

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Develop demo application showing example usage of voiceband channel.
#. Integrate voiceband infrastructure with Zaptel/DAHDI telephony
   hardware drivers.

--------------

Grand Central Dispatch - FreeBSD port
-------------------------------------

URL: http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/

| Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Stacey Son <sson@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: libdispatch mailing list
  <libdispatch-dev@lists.macosforge.org\ >

We have ported libdispatch, Apple's Grand Central Dispatch event and
concurrency framework to FreeBSD:

-  Added new kqueue primitives required to support GCD, such as
   EVFILT\_USER and EV\_TRIGGER
-  Created autoconf and automake build framework for libdispatch
-  Modified libdispatch to use POSIX semaphores instead of Mach
   semaphores
-  Adapted libdispatch to use portable POSIX time routines

Jordan Hubbard has also prepared a blocks-aware clang compiler package
for FreeBSD. When compiled with clang, libdispatch provides
blocks-based, as well as function-based callbacks.

The port was presented at the FreeBSD Developer Summit in Cambridge, UK
in September, and slides are online on the devsummit wiki page. A
FreeBSD port is now available in the Ports Collection. After FreeBSD
8.0-RELEASE has shipped, the new kqueue primitives will be MFC'd so that
libdispatch works out of the box on FreeBSD 8.1-RELEASE.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Complete porting of libdispatch test suite to FreeBSD.
#. Investigate pthread work queue implementation for FreeBSD.
#. Evaluate performance impact of some machine-dependent and
   OS-dependent optimizations present in the Mac OS X version of
   libdispatch to decide if they should be done for other platforms and
   OS's.
#. Explore whether FreeBSD base operating system tools would benefit
   from being modified to use libdispatch.

--------------

libprocstat(3) - process statistics
-----------------------------------

URL: http://svn.freebsd.org/viewvc/base/projects/libprocstat/

| Contact: Stanislav Sedov <stas@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Ulf Lilleengen <lulf@FreeBSD.org\ >

The libprocstat project is an ongoing effort to develop a library that
can be used to retrieve information about running processes and open
files in the uniform and platform-independent way both from a running
system or from core files. This will facilitate the implementation of
file- or process-monitoring applications like lsof(1), fstat(1), fuser,
etc. The libprocstat repository contains a preliminary version of the
library. It also includes rewrites of the fstat and the fuser utilities
ported to use this library instead of retrieving all the required
information via the kvm(3) interface; one of the important advantages of
the versions that use libprocstat is that these utilities are ABI
independent.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Implement KVM-based namecache lookup to retrieve filesystem paths
   associated with file descriptors and VM objects.
#. Analyze possible ways of exporting file and process information from
   the kernel in an extensible and ABI-independent way.

--------------

New BSD licensed debugger
-------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/TheBsdDebugger
|  URL: http://people.freebsd.org/~dfr/ngdb.git
|  URL:
  http://wiki.freebsd.org/200909DevSummit?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=NGDB-200909.pdf

Contact: Doug Rabson <` <mailto:>`__\ >

I have been working recently on writing a new debugger, primarily for
the FreeBSD platform. For various reasons, I have been writing it in a
relatively obscure C-like language called D.

So far, I have a pretty useful (if a little raw at the edges) command
line debugger which supports ELF, Dwarf debugging information and
(currently) 32 bit FreeBSD and Linux. The engine includes parsing and
evaluation of arbitrary C expressions along with the usual debugging
tools such as breakpoints, source code listing, single-step etc. All the
code is new and BSD licensed. Currently, the thing supports userland
debugging of i386 targets via ptrace and post-mortem core file debugging
of the same. I will be adding amd64 support real soon (TM) and maybe
support for GDB's remote debugging protocol later.

--------------

NFSv4 ACLs
----------

URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/NFSv4_ACLs

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org\ >

During Google Summer of Code 2008, I have implemented native support for
NFSv4 ACLs for both ZFS and UFS. Most of the code has already been
merged to CURRENT. NFSv4 ACLs are unconditionally enabled in ZFS and the
usual tools, like getfacl(1) and setfacl(1) can be used to view and
change them. I plan to merge the remaining bits (UFS support) this
month. It should be possible to MFC it in order to ship in FreeBSD
8.1-RELEASE.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. UFS changes review
#. Support for NFSv4 ACLs in tar(1)

--------------

The Newcons project
-------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/Newcons
|  URL: http://people.freebsd.org/~ed/newcons/patches/

Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@FreeBSD.org\ >

Some time ago I started writing a new driver for the FreeBSD kernel
called vt(4), which is basically a replacement of syscons. There is
still a lot of work that needs to be done but it is probably useful to
mention what it does (and what does not).

Right now there are just two graphics drivers for vt(4), namely a VGA
driver for i386 and amd64 and a Microsoft Xbox graphics driver (because
it was so easy to implement). I still have to figure out what I am going
to do with VESA, because maybe it is better to just ignore VESA and
figure out how hard it is to extend DRM to interact with vt(4).

Some random features: it already supports both Unicode (UTF-8) input and
output, it is MPSAFE and supports per-window graphical fonts of variable
dimensions, containing an almost infinite amount of glyphs (both bold
and regular).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Research needs to be done on DRM's codebase.
#. Syscons should already be migrated to TERM=xterm to make switching
   between drivers a bit easier.

--------------

VirtualBox on FreeBSD
---------------------

URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox

| Contact: Beat Gaetzi <beat@FreeBSD.org\ >

|  Contact: Dennis Herrmann <dhn@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Martin Wilke <miwi@FreeBSD.org\ >

VirtualBox has been committed to the Ports tree and synchronized with
the latest trunk version from Sun. Several known problems are already
fixed and some new features have been added:

-  VT-x support
-  Bridging support (Big Thanks to Fredrik Lindberg)
-  Host Serial Support
-  ACPI Support
-  Host DVD/CD access
-  SMP Support

We would like to say thanks to all the people who helped us by reporting
bugs and submitting fixes. We also thank the VirtualBox developers for
their help with the ongoing effort to port VirtualBox on FreeBSD.

We continue to classify PRs as they arrive, adding 'tags' to the subject
lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem involved, or man page
references for userland PRs. These tags, in turn, produce lists of PRs
sorted both by tag and by manpage.

The list of PRs recommended for committer evaluation by the Bugbusting
Team continues to receive new additions. This list contains PRs, mostly
with patches, that the Bugbusting Team feel are probably ready to be
committed as-is, or are probably trivially resolved in the hands of a
committer with knowledge of the particular subsystem. All committers are
invited to take a look at this list whenever they have a spare 5 minutes
and wish to close a PR.

A full list of all the automatically generated reports is also available
at one of the cited URLs. Any recommendations for reports which not
currently exist but which would be beneficial are welcomed.

Gavin Atkinson gave a presentation on "The PR Collection Status" at the
EuroBSDCon 2009 DevSummit, and discussed with other participants several
other ideas to make the PR database more useful and usable. Several good
ideas came from this, and will hopefully lead to more useful tools in
the near future. Discussions also took place on how it may be possible
to automatically classify non-ports PRs with a view towards notifying
interested parties, although investigations into this have not yet
begun.

Mark Linimon also continues attempting to define the general problem and
investigating possible new workflow models, and presented work on this
at BSDCan 2009.

Since the last status report, the number of open bugs has increased to
around the 5900 mark, partially because of an increased focus on getting
more information into the existing PRs, in an attempt to make sure all
the information required is now available. As a result, although the
number of open PRs has increased, they are hopefully of better quality.

As always, more help is appreciated, and committers and non-committers
alike are always invited to join us on #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet and
help close stale PRs or commit patches from valid PRs.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Work on suggestions from developers who were at the EuroBSDCon
   DevSummit.
#. Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing the
   PRs that the team has already analyzed.

Since the spring, the FreeBSD KDE team has been busy upgrading KDE from
4.2.0 up through to 4.3.1. As part of the ongoing maintenance of KDE,
the team also updated Qt4 from 4.4.3 through to 4.5.2

We added two new committers/maintainers to the team, Kris Moore
(kmoore@) and Dima Panov (fluffy@). We also granted enhanced area51
access to contributors Alberto Villa and Raphael Kubo da Costa. Alberto
has been our key contributor updating and testing Qt 4.6.0-tp1. Raphael
is a KDE developer, who has become our Gitorious liaison, he has been
responsible for getting FreeBSD Qt patches merged in upstream.

Markus Br?ffer (markus@) spent a lot of time patching widgets and system
plugins so they would work under FreeBSD. We would like to thank him for
all his effort!

Open tasks:

The ports count has soared to over 20,700. The PR count had been driven
below 800 by some extraordinary effort, but once again is back to its
usual count of around 900.

We are currently building packages for amd64-6, amd64-7, amd64-8,
i386-6, i386-7, i386-8, sparc64-7, and sparc64-8. There have been
preliminary runs of i386-9; however, to be able to continue builds on
-9, we will either need to find places to host a number of new machines,
or drop package building for -6. The mailing list discussion of the
latter proved quite controversial.

We have added some new i386 machines to help speed up the builds, but
this only makes up for the disk failures on some of our older, slower,
i386 nodes.

We also appreciate the loan of more package build machines from several
committers, including pgollucci@, gahr@, erwin@, Boris Kochergin, and
Craig Butler.

The portmgr@ team has also welcomed new members Ion-Mihai Tetcu
(itetcu@) and Martin Wilke (miwi@). We also thank departing member
Kirill Ponomarew (krion@) for his long service.

Ion-Mihai has spent much time working on a system that does automatic
Quality Assurance on new commits, called QAT. A second tinderbox called
QATty has helped us to fix many problems, especially those involving
custom PREFIX and LOCALBASE settings, and documentation inclusion
options. Ports conformance to documented features / non-default
configuration will follow.

Between pav and miwi, over 2 dozen experimental ports runs have been
completed and committed.

We have added 5 new committers since the last report, and 2 older ones
have rejoined.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. We are currently trying to set up ports tinderboxes that can be made
   available to committers for pre-testing; those who can loan machines
   for this should contact Ion-Mihai (itetcu@) with details regarding
   the hardware and bandwidth.
#. Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR assigned to
   committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is helping to keep
   the backlog down, we are going to need to do more to get the ports in
   the shape they really need to be in.
#. Although we have added many maintainers, we still have almost 4,700
   unmaintained ports (see, for instance, the list on portsmon). (The
   percentage is down to 22%.) We are always looking for dedicated
   volunteers to adopt at least a few unmaintained ports. As well, the
   packages on amd64 and sparc64 lag behind i386, and we need more
   testers for those.

The Release Engineering Team continues to work on FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE.
Public testing has turned up quite a few problems, many related to the
low-level network (routing/ARP table) changes and their interactions
with IPv6.

Progress continues to be made on fixing up the issues that have been
identified during the public testing. At this point in time we are
shooting for two more public test builds (RC2 and RC3) followed by the
release late October or early November.

TCP appropriate byte counting (RFC 3465) support has been merged into
the FreeBSD 8 branch and will ship in FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE.

The reassembly queue auto-tuning and SIFTR work was not ready in time to
safely integrate for 8.0-RELEASE. Padding has been added to necessary
TCP structs to facilitate MFCing features back to the 8-STABLE branch
after 8.0 is released.

Candidate patches against FreeBSD-CURRENT will be ready for wider
testing in the coming weeks. The
`freebsd-net <mailto:freebsd-net@FreeBSD.org>`__ mailing list will be
solicited for testing/feedback when everything is ready.

Contact: Lawrence Stewart <lstewart@freebsd.org\ >

The patch has received some significant rototilling in the past few
months to prepare it for merging to FreeBSD-CURRENT. Additionally, I
completed an implementation of the CUBIC congestion control algorithm to
complement the existing NewReno and H-TCP algorithm implementations
already available.

I have one further intrusive change to make, which will allow congestion
control modules to be shared between the TCP and SCTP stacks. Once this
is complete, I will be soliciting for review/testing in the hope of
committing the patch to FreeBSD-CURRENT in time to be able to backport
it for 8.1-RELEASE.

Open tasks:

#. Abstract the congestion control specific variables out of the TCP and
   SCTP control blocks into a new struct that can be passed into the API

Network Stack Virtualization

The network stack virtualization project aims at extending the FreeBSD
kernel to maintain multiple independent instances of networking state.
This allows for networking independence between jail environment, each
maintaining its private network interfaces, IPv4 and IPv6 network and
port address space, routing tables, IPSec configuration, firewalls, and
more.

During the last months the remaining pieces of the VIMAGE work were
merged by Marko, Julian and Bjoern. Robert Watson developed a vnet
allocator to overcome ABI issues. Jamie Gritton merged his hierarchical
jail framework that now also is the management interface for virtual
network stacks.

During the FreeBSD Developer Summit that took place at EuroBSDCon 2009
in Cambridge, UK, people virtualized more code. As a result SCTP and
another accept filter were virtualized and more people became familiar
with the design of VImage and the underlying concepts. Finally getting
more hands involved was a crucial first step for the long term success
of kernel virtualization.

The next steps will be to finish the network stack virtualization,
generalize the allocator framework before thinking of virtualizing
further subsystems and to update the related documentation. Along with
that a proper jail management framework will be worked on. Long term
goals, amongst others, will be to virtualize more subsystems like SYS-V
IPC, better privilege handling, and resource limits.

In the upcoming FreeBSD 8.0 Release, vnets are treated as an
experimental feature. As a result, they are not yet recommended for use
in production environments. There was lots of time spent to finalize the
infrastructure for vnets though, so that further changes can be merged
and we are aiming to have things production ready for 8.2.

In case you want to help to achieve this goal, feel free to contact us
and support or help virtualizing outstanding parts like two firewalls,
appletalk, netipx, ... as well as generating regression tests.

--------------

Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
-------------------------------------------

Contact: Randall Stewart <rrs@FreeBSD\ >

SCTP continues to have minor fixes added to it as well as some new
features. First and foremost, we now have VIMAGE and SCTP working and
playing together. This goal was accomplished with the help of bz@, my
new mentee tuexen@ and myself working together at the FreeBSD DevSummit
in Cambridge, UK. Also the non-renegable SACK feature contributed by the
university of Delaware was fixed so that now its safe to turn on (its
sysctl). If you are using SCTP with CMT (Conncurrent Multipath Transfer)
you will want to enable this option (CMT is also a sysctl). With CMT
enabled you will be able to send data to all the destinations of an SCTP
peer.

We welcomed a new mentee (soon to be a commiter) to FreeBSD. Michael
Tuexen is now a mentee of rrs@. Michael has been contributing to the
SCTP work for quite some time and also moonlights as a Professor at the
University of Muenster in Germany (when not doing SCTP coding).

FreeBSD/sparc64
---------------

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org\ >

Noteworthy developments regarding FreeBSD/sparc64 since the last Status
Reports are:

-  Cas(4), a driver for Sun Cassini/Cassini+, as well as National
   Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit NICs has been committed and thus
   will be part of FreeBSD beginning with 8.0-RELEASE and 7.3-RELEASE,
   respectively. This means that the on-board NICs found in Fire V440,
   as well as the add-on cards based on these chips, are now supported,
   including on non-sparc64 machines. Unfortunately, the cas(4) driver
   triggers what seem to be secondary problems with the on-board NICs
   found in B100 blades and Fire V480, which due to lack of access to
   such systems could not be fixed so far.
-  Initial support for sun4u machines based on the "Fire"
   Host-PCI-Express bridge like Fire V215, V245, etc. has been completed
   (including support for the on-board ATA controller, which caused
   several problems at first, and MSI/MSI-X). Some code like the quirk
   handling for the ALi/ULi chips found in these machines needs to be
   revisited though and no stability tests have been conducted so far.
   If all goes well, the code will hit HEAD some time after FreeBSD
   8.0-RELEASE has been released. In theory, machines based on the
   "Oberon" Host-PCI-Express bridge, at least for the most part, should
   also be supported with these changes, but due to lack of access to a
   Mx000 series machine the code could not be tested with these so far.
-  Some bugs in the snd\_t4dwave(4) driver have been fixed, as well as
   some special handling for sparc64 has been added so it does 32-bit
   DMA and now generally works with the on-board ALi M5451 found for
   example in Blade 100 and Blade 1500. Unfortunately, it was only
   tested to work correctly in two out of three Blade 100. Why it still
   does not work correctly in the remaining one is currently unknown but
   at least no longer causes IOMMU-panics so testing snd\_t4dwave(4) on
   sparc64 is no longer harmful. These changes will be part of FreeBSD
   8.0-RELEASE and 7.3-RELEASE.
-  Ata-marvell(4) has been fixed to work on sparc64 (actually also on
   anything that is not x86 with less than 4GB of RAM). These fixes will
   be part of FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE and 7.3-RELEASE.
-  A proper and machine-independent fix for the old problem that the
   loader leaves the NIC opened by the firmware, which could lead to
   panics during boot when netbooting, has been developed but not
   committed yet.

Andreas Tobler made the classic mistake of sending us a lot of powerpc
and sparc64 related patches. The usual punishment, of giving him a
commit bit to the Gecko repository, has been applied.

We currently have some old ports in the ports tree:

-  www/mozilla is 5 year old now, no longer supported upstream, and has
   a lot of security vulnerabilities. We can use www/seamonkey instead.
-  www/xulrunner is superseeded by www/libxul.

A patch that includes the following changes has been tested on pointyhat
and is ready for commit:

-  Remove references to www/mozilla/Makefile.common and
   www/mozilla/bsd.gecko.mk
-  Switch USE\_GECKO= xulrunner firefox mozilla to USE\_GECKO= libxul
   and remove www/xulrunner

We are also working on Firefox 3.6 (Alpha 2), Thunderbird 3.0 (Beta 4),
new libxul 1.9.1.3 and Seamonkey 2.0 (Beta 2) ports. All of them are
already committed to our Gecko repository.

I am currently seeking funding for further development work on

very much like to implement but that will take more time than I can
reasonably volunteer to implement correctly. There is information about
the funding proposal available at the link above.

Meanwhile I have recently completed another round of bug fixes and
feature enhancements. The often-requested ability to specify the -x
(exclude) option more than once on the command line was added in version
2.12. Also in that version I added the --list-origins option to make it
easier to reinstall ports after a major version upgrade, or install the
same set of ports on another system.

University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, the workshop-style event
consisted of prepared presentations, as well as group hacking and
discussion sessions. Talks covered topics including 802.11 mesh
networking, virtual network stacks and kernels, a new BSD-licensed
debugger, benchmarking, bugbusting, NetFPGA, a port of Apple's GCD
(Grand Central Dispatch) to FreeBSD, security policy work, cryptographic
signatures, FreeBSD.org system administration, time geeks, a new console

New approach to the locale database
-----------------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/LocaleNewApproach
|  URL: svn://svn.freebsd.org/base/user/edwin/locale

| Contact: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: i18n mailinglist <freebsd-i18n@FreeBSD.org\ >

Problem: Over the years the FreeBSD locale database (share/colldef,
share/monetdef, share/msgdef, share/numericdef, share/timedef) has
accumulated a total of 165 definitions (language - country-code -
character-set triplets). The contents of the files for Western European
languages are often low-ASCII but for Eastern European and Asian
languages partly or fully high-ASCII. Without knowing how to display or
interpret the character-sets, it is difficult to make sure by the
general audience that the local language (language - country-code)
definitions are displayed properly in various character-sets.

Suggested approach: With the combination of the data in the Unicode
project (whose goal is to define all the possible written characters and
symbols on this planet) and the Common Locale Data Repository (whose
goal is to document all the different data and definitions needed for
the locale database), we can easily keep track of the data, without the
need of being able to display the data in the required character sets or
understand them fully when updates are submitted by third parties.

Current status: Conversion of share/monetdef, share/msgdef,
share/numericdef, share/timedef to the new design is completed. The
Makefile infrastructure is converted. Regression checks are done. Most
of the tools are in place, waiting on the import of bsdiconv to the base
system.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. At this moment the system is not self-hosted yet, because of the lack
   of an iconv-kind of program in the base operating system. Gabor@ is
   working on bsdiconv as a GSoC project and once that has been imported
   we will be able to perform a clean install from the definitions in
   Unicode text format to the required formats and character sets.

Since their public launch in November 2008, the FreeBSD Forums (the most
recent addition to the user community and support channels for the
FreeBSD Operating System) have witnessed a healthy and steady growth.

The user population is now at over 8,000 registered users, who have
participated in over 6,000 topics, containing over 40,000 posts in
total. The sign-up rate hovers between 50-100 each week. The total
number of visitors (including 'guests') is hard to gauge but is likely
to be a substantial multiple of the registered userbase.

New topics and posts are actively 'pushed out' to search engines. This
in turn makes the Forums show up in search results more and more often,
making it a valuable and very accessible source of information for the
FreeBSD community.

One of the contributing factors to the Forums' success is their
'BSD-style' approach when it comes to administration and moderation. The
Forums have a strong and unified identity, they are neatly divided into
sub-forums (like 'Networking', 'Installing & Upgrading', etc.), very
actively moderated, spam-free, and with a core group of very active and
helpful members, dispensing many combined decades' worth of knowledge to
starting, intermediate and professional users of FreeBSD.

We expect the Forums to be, and to remain, a central hub in FreeBSD's
community and support efforts.
