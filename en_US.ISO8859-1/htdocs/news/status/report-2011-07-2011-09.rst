--------------

HAST (Highly Available Storage) status update
---------------------------------------------

| Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Mikolaj Golub <trociny@FreeBSD.org\ >

HAST is under active development. Some changes since Q1 report:

-  Async replication mode. Unfortunately it will not make it into
   9.0-RELEASE (pjd@).
-  IPv6 support (pjd@).
-  Activemap fix that significantly reduces number of metadata updates
   (trociny@).

--------------

pfSense
-------

URL: http://www.pfsense.org/

| Contact: Scott Ullrich <sullrich@gmail.com\ >
|  Contact: Chris Buechler <cbuechler@gmail.com\ >

pfSense 2.0 has been released to the world. This brings the past three
years of new feature additions, with significant enhancements to almost
every portion of the system. The changes and new features are
`summarized
here <http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/2.0_New_Features_and_Changes>`__.
This is by far the most widely deployed release we have put out, thanks
to the efforts of thousands of members of the community.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Work on 2.1 is underway with the biggest changes being IPV6 support
   and PBI packaged binaries for the package system.

--------------

Tool for providing FreeBSD VM Images
------------------------------------

URL: https://github.com/yerenkow/freebsd-vm-image

Contact: Alexander Yerenkow <yerenkow@gmail.com\ >

A set of scripts to make building FreeBSD VM images easy.

Providing a way to make regular build images of the latest version from
SVN. Images currently can be copied with \`dd\` to USB flash (for
testing on real hardware) and VirtualBox (.vdi).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Build images with ports-set from main port-tree
#. Build images with ports-set from main port-tree plus overrides from
   area51 (like experimental images)
#. Build images with special development branches included (like for
   testing drivers)

--------------

ZFSguru
-------

| URL: http://zfsguru.com
|  URL: http://zfsguru.com

Contact: Jason Edwards <guru@ZFSguru.com\ >

ZFSguru is a newly designed Network Attached Storage operating system,
much like FreeNAS. The difference is that ZFSguru focuses heavily on ZFS
and user friendly operation, and uses a full FreeBSD distribution with
no elements stripped down. This allows people new to FreeBSD and UNIX in
general to access the power of ZFS, while still allowing more advanced
users to tweak their NAS with additional functionality and use it as a
normal FreeBSD distribution.

Started a little over a year ago, the ZFSguru project is making good
progress. It should already be one of the most user friendly
distributions focused on ZFS, and sports some very unique features. The
advanced ZFS benchmarking and convenient Root-on-ZFS installation are
good examples. Priority is given to finishing the missing core
functionality, and extending the number of available service addons
which currently are limited to iSCSI-target and VirtualBox extensions.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Finish ZFS and network related functionality in the web-interface.
#. Introduce new service addons, adding optional functionality to
   ZFSguru.
#. Extend the documentation.

--------------

ZRouter.org project — a FreeBSD-based firmware for embedded devices
-------------------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://zrouter.org
|  URL: http://lists.zrouter.org
|  URL: http://zrouter.org/hg/zrouter/
|  URL: http://zrouter.org/hg/FreeBSD/head/

Contact: Aleksandr Rybalko <ray@FreeBSD.org\ >

ZRouter.org is a young project that aims to produce FreeBSD-based
firmware for small boxes such as SOHO router, APs, etc. At the present
time ZRouter.org is able to build working firmware for:

-  D-Link DAP-1350
-  D-Link DIR-320
-  D-Link DIR-320-NRU
-  D-Link DIR-330
-  D-Link DIR-615-E4
-  D-Link DIR-620
-  D-Link DIR-632
-  D-Link DSA-3110-A1
-  D-Link DSR-1000N
-  NorthQ NQ-900
-  TPLink TL-WR941ND-v3\_2
-  Ubiquiti RSPRO

Currently we are working on most parts of the core system but we are
also in the planning phase for implementing a simple web-based GUI which
we hope will have taken form before the next FreeBSD status report.

We still have many items not done, so devices in that list cannot be
called "Production Ready" yet. But we work on that.

It is easy to add new devices, because we have separate definition of
board and SoC(System on Chip), so if you have "Asus WL-500g Premium v2"
for example, you can copy D-Link/DIR-320 directory and tweak to work for
your device. We already have basic support for:

-  Broadcom BCM5354
-  Broadcom BCM5836
-  Ralink RT3052F
-  Ralink RT3050F
-  Ralink RT5350F
-  Atheros AR7161
-  Atheros AR7242
-  Atheros AR7241
-  Atheros AR7240
-  Atheros AR9132
-  Intel ixp435
-  Cavium CN5010

If you have ability and time, please join us at http://zrouter.org
(Redmine interface and mailing lists)

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Device drivers
#. Web UI
#. Control scripts
#. Watchdog
#. etc.

Ports Collection
----------------

| URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/
|  URL:
  http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributing-ports/
|  URL: http://portsmon.FreeBSD.org/index.html
|  URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/portmgr/index.html
|  URL: http://blogs.FreeBSDish.org/portmgr/
|  URL: http://www.twitter.com/freebsd_portmgr/
|  URL: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=135441496471197

| Contact: Thomas Abthorpe <portmgr-secretary@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Port Management Team <portmgr@FreeBSD.org\ >

The ports tree slowly moves up closer to the 23,000 mark. The PR count
still remains at about 1000.

In Q2 we added 4 new committers, but took in 6 commit bits for safe
keeping.

The Ports Management team have been running -exp runs on an ongoing
basis, verifying how base system updates may affect the ports tree, as
well as providing QA runs for major ports updates. Of note, -exp runs
were done for:

-  Python update
-  Boost updates
-  Gtk3 updates
-  clang testing
-  pkgng testing
-  testing ruby19
-  setting the default fortran to lang/gcc46
-  setting apache22 as default
-  setting the default LDFLAGS in CONFIGURE\_ENV

Work continues to refine the new build master pointyhat-west. An upgrade
to -current done in September has proven problematic. We have enlisted
ISC and Josh Paetzel to try to determine a fix. In the meantime, the
source will be downgraded to RELENG\_9.

The portsmon instance is being re-homed at Yahoo. Users should not see
any changes. The new instance is currently visible at
portsmonj.FreeBSD.org but will soon take on the portsmon.FreeBSD.org
name. The team would like to express its appreciation to TDC A/S for the
loan of the existing machine for several years.

Work is underway to create a new QAT instance at NYI/NJ.

portmgr also assisted in setting up a sparc64 machine for general
develop access at Yahoo.

Thanks to on-site work by Sean Bruno and Ben Haga, we once again have
access to the powerpc build machine at ISC, and powerpc builds have been
restarted. They also helped us get one more i386 machine back online.

linimon is working on a set of scripts to more quickly produce
pre-configured PXEboot images for package build nodes.

The update of \_\_FreeBSD\_version in param.h to 1000000 proved very
disruptive to the ports tree, triggering lots of bad assumption in code
that interpreted it as FreeBSD 1. A great deal of work has gone into
identifying the instances of broken code and fixing and upstreaming
them. While this is taking place, one recommended workaround is to set
your version to 999999.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Looking for help getting `ports to build with
   clang <http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/PortsAndClang>`__.
#. Looking for help fixing `ports broken on
   CURRENT <http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/PortsBrokenOnCurrent>`__. (List
   needs updating, too)
#. Looking for help with `Tier-2
   architectures <http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/PortsBrokenOnTier2Architectures>`__.
   (List needs updating, too)
#. Most ports PRs are assigned, we now need to focus on testing,
   committing and closing.

The FreeBSD Foundation
----------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org\ >

The Foundation sponsored KyivBSD 2011 which was held in Kiev, Ukraine on
September 24. We were represented at Ohio LinuxFest in Columbus, Ohio.
And, we approved six travel grants for EuroBSDCon. Stop by and visit us
at the FreeBSD booth during LISA '11, December 7-8, in Boston, MA.

Three Foundation funded projects were completed during this period:
implementing xlocale APIs to enable porting libc++ by David Chisnall,
implementing DIFFUSE for FreeBSD by Swinburne University, and adding
GEM, KMS, and DRI support for Intel drivers by Konstantin Belousov.

We published our `semi-annual
newsletter <http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/press/2011Aug-newsletter.shtml>`__.
We purchased servers and other hardware for the FreeBSD co-location
centers at Sentex and NYI.

The work above, as well as many other tasks which we do for the FreeBSD
Project, could not be done without donations. Please help us by making a
donation or asking your company to make a donation. We would be happy to
send marketing literature to you or your company. Find out how to make a
donation at `our donate
page <http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/donate/>`__.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team
------------------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Contact: Release Engineering Team <re@FreeBSD.org\ >

The Release Engineering Team has been coordinating the upcoming FreeBSD
9.0-RELEASE. Thanks to work done by many of the developers. The release,
though delayed, is taking the shape nicely. We have reached the stage of
doing the second Release Candidate. At this time we expect to have one
more Release Candidate, to be followed by the final release itself.

--------------

AR5416, AR9160, and AR9280 functions in both station and hostap mode.
Performance is good.

Software retry of frames is implemented. Aggregation is implemented.

BAR TX is not yet handled. HT protection is not implemented; neither is
MIMO powersave.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. BAR TX
#. MIMO powersave
#. Correct handling of flushing TX queues during interface
   reset/reconfigure
#. Correct handling of 20<->20/40mhz transitions (without dropping
   frames)
#. More intelligent rate control

--------------

DIstributed Firewall and Flow-shaper Using Statistical Evidence (DIFFUSE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/freebsd/diffused/
|  URL:
  http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/project%20announcements.shtml#diffuse
|  URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/
|  URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/downloads.html

| Contact: Sebastian Zander <szander@swin.edu.au\ >
|  Contact: Lawrence Stewart <lastewart@swin.edu.au\ >
|  Contact: Grenville Armitage <garmitage@swin.edu.au\ >

DIFFUSE enables FreeBSD's IPFW firewall subsystem to classify IP traffic
based on statistical traffic properties.

With DIFFUSE, IPFW computes statistics (such as packet lengths or
inter-packet time intervals) for observed flows, and uses ML (machine
learning) to classify flows into classes. In addition to traditional
packet inspection rules, IPFW rules may now also be expressed in terms
of traffic statistics or classes identified by ML classification. This
can be helpful when direct packet inspection is problematic (perhaps for
administrative reasons, or because port numbers do not reliably identify
applications).

DIFFUSE also enables one instance of IPFW to send flow information and
classes to other IPFW instances, which then can act on such traffic
(e.g. prioritise, accept, deny, etc.) according to its class. This
allows for distributed architectures, where classification at one
location in your network is used to control fire-walling or rate-shaping
actions at other locations.

The FreeBSD Foundation has funded the Centre for Advanced Internet
Architectures at Swinburne University of Technology to undertake the
DIFFUSED (DIFFUSE for freebsD) project, which aims to refine our
publicly released DIFFUSE prototype and integrate all components of the
architecture into FreeBSD.

The project is progressing well in the diffused\_head project branch of
the FreeBSD Subversion repository, and is due to be completed by the end
of October 2011. Once the project is completed, the code will be merged
from the project branch into the head branch. An MFC of the code to 8.x
and 9.x should be possible after an appropriate amount of soak time has
elapsed.

--------------

Ethernet Switch Framework
-------------------------

URL: http://zrouter.org/hg/FreeBSD/head/file/default/head/sys/dev/switch

Contact: Aleksandr Rybalko <ray@FreeBSD.org\ >

Many embedded devices have an Ethernet switch on board; such switches
are even embedded on some multiport NICs. This embedded switch framework
is designed to give users the ability to easily control basic features
present in managed switches, such as VLANs, QoS, port mirroring, etc.
Currently we are able to control only VLANs on:

-  Atheros AR8216/AR8316 (standalone and embedded in AR724X)
-  Broadcom BCM5325 switch family (also embedded in BCM5354 SoC)
-  Ralink RT3050F/RT3052F internal switch
-  Realtek RTL8309
-  IP175X
-  IP178X

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Fix AR8216/AR8316 driver
#. Fix BCM5325 driver, not all ports pass data
#. Add tick handler for RTL8309 to automatically unisolate ports
#. Unify MIB statistic counters access
#. Add mii read/write bus methods
#. Implement pseudo interfaces for switch PHYs

--------------

The new CARP
------------

URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~glebius/newcarp/

Contact: Gleb Smirnoff <glebius@FreeBSD.org\ >

I am now working on significant rewrite of CARP in FreeBSD.

The reason for this work is that the CARP protocol actually does not
bring a new interface, but is a property of interface address. Rewriting
it in this way helps to remove several hacks from incoming packet
processing, simplifies some code, makes CARP addresses more sane from
the viewpoint of routing daemons such as quagga/zebra and closes many
CARP-related PRs in GNATS. It also brings support for a single redundant
address on the subnet, the thing that is called "carpdev feature" in
OpenBSD, long awaited in FreeBSD.

For this moment I have a patch against head/ that compiles and works in
my test environment that I am going to deploy soon on some of servers
under my control.

The patch has been reviewed by Bjoern Zeeb (bz@).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. More testing requested!
#. Implement arpbalance and ipbalance features. This requires a next
   step of rewriting, probably borrowing some ideas from OpenBSD.
#. Update documentation.

--------------

VM layer for allocations larger than a page
-------------------------------------------

| Contact: Alan Cox <alc@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Davide Italiano <davide.italiano@gmail.com\ >

The aim of this project is to create a new layer that sits between UMA
and the virtual memory system managing chunks of kernel virtual memory
on the order of 2 to 4 MB in size. At the end of the work, UMA
page\_alloc() would no longer call directly into the VM system. It would
instead call into this new layer. Thus, uma\_large\_malloc() and
uma\_large\_free() would no longer be immediately allocating and
deallocating kernel virtual memory. This results in a gain in terms of
performances (there is a relatively high cost in the approach adopted
until now), and also in terms of reduction of fragmentation (the VM
system uses a first-fit policy of allocation so there is room for
improvements).

--------------

Doc sprint on IRC, September 5, 2011
------------------------------------

URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~bcr/doc/sprints/20110905-final.html

| Contact: Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Dru Lavigne <dru@FreeBSD.org\ >

On September 5, we held another documentation sprint on IRC channel
#bsddocs to discuss various issues that are important for the whole
FreeBSD documentation community. We talked about the status of the
planned documentation repository conversion to SVN and the status of the
XML docbook conversion. At that point in time, we did not have any
documentation regarding the new bsdinstaller in the upcoming release,
which would have been very bad for users that were trying to install the
release. Luckily, a small team formed quickly to start working on a new
bsdinstall chapter from scratch using a separate Google code repository
that gjb@ had set up.

Some of the topics we discussed were moved forward and their status was
revisited at EuroBSDcon's devsummit documentation session. Before the
end of the conference, we had a new bsdinstall chapter committed into
the official documentation tree, thanks to the efforts put into the new
chapter by Gavin Atkinson, Warren Block, and Glen Barber. Garrett Cooper
provided valuable instructions on the various installation methods that
are possible with the new bsdinstaller. Thanks to all who helped make
this a reality.

It is nice to see that the things we talked about at the documentation
sprint developed further, which is why we are trying to do these sprints
in regular intervals.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Plan the next documentation sprint
#. Continue working on the issues that are still open like the
   conversion of the repository to SVN

--------------

The FreeBSD German Documentation Project Status Report
------------------------------------------------------

URL: https://doc.bsdgroup.de

| Contact: Johann Kois <jkois@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org\ >

We managed to update the German version of the documentation just in
time to get it included in the upcoming 9.0-RELEASE. The website
translations were also kept in sync with the ones on FreeBSD.org.

We tried to re-activate committers who did not contribute for some time
but most of them are currently unable to free up enough time. We hope to
gain fresh contributor blood as we are getting occasional reports about
bugs and grammar in the German translation.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Submit grammar, spelling or other errors you find in the German
   documents and the website
#. Translate more articles and other open handbook sections (especially
   the new chapter about the new FreeBSD installer).

After a few rather quiet months, the FreeBSD Greek Documentation Project
is back on track, translating and improving the Handbook, FAQ and
FreeBSD articles. The new bsdinstall chapter has been translated and is
now present in the Handbook. Our `experimental Handbook
builds <http://www.FreeBSDgr.org/handbook>`__ are also available at the
project's hub. Three new status pages have been added:

-  `Merge Status for the en\_US
   tree <http://www.FreeBSDgr.org/versions.html>`__ shows whether the
   local en\_US repo is in sync with the official CVS
-  `Merge Status for the el\_GR
   tree <http://www.FreeBSDgr.org/versionsel.html>`__ - as above but for
   the Greek tree
-  `Pending Commits <http://www.FreeBSDgr.org/pending.html>`__ shows
   newer yet to be committed versions of the Greek docs

For more information, please visit
`http://www.freebsdgr.org <http://www.FreeBSDgr.org>`__. Patches, fixes
and contributions are always welcome.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Translate the remaining chapters of the Handbook to Greek.
#. Complete the translation of the FreeBSD FAQ.
#. Keep the currently translated docs in sync with the English versions.

The www/ja and doc/ja\_JP.eucJP/books/handbook subtrees have constantly
been updated since the last report.

www/ja: During this period, many areas of outdated content in the www/ja
subtree were updated to the latest versions of the English counterparts.
The Japanese version of the 8.2R release announcement was added and the
upcoming 9.0R announcement will be translated in a timely manner.

Handbook: The Japanese "kernelconfig" section finally caught up with the
original English version. The next targets are "cutting-edge" and the
new installer section.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Further translation work for outdated documents in both
   doc/ja\_JP.eucJP and www/ja.

Marvell Armada XP is a complete system-on-chip solution based on the
Sheeva embedded CPUs. These devices integrate up to four ARMv6/v7
compliant Sheeva CPU cores with shared L2 cache.

This work is extending FreeBSD/arm infrastructure towards support for
recent ARM architecture variations along with a basic set of device
drivers for integrated peripherals.

The following code has been implemented since the last status report:

PCI-Express support
SMP support

-  Created framework for ARM platform dependent code.
-  Initialization and starting of Application Processor.
-  Implementation of sending/handling IPI

Next steps:

-  Finalize SMP support (TLB/cache operation broadcast, etc.)
-  L2 cache support
-  SATA driver

PACKETpro family of embedded processors.

The chip includes two Power Architecture PPC465 processor cores, which
are compliant with the Book-E specification of the architecture, and a
number of integrated peripherals.

This work is extending current Book-E support in FreeBSD towards PPC4xx
processor variants along with device drivers for integrated
peripherials.

The following drivers have been created since the last report:

-  Interrupt controller
-  EHCI USB driver attachment
-  Queue Manager/Traffic Manager support
-  Initial support of Ethernet controller
-  GPIO, I2C

Next steps:

FreeBSD Haskell Ports
---------------------

| Contact: Gabor Janos PaLI <pgj@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Ashish SHUKLA <ashish@FreeBSD.org\ >

We updated existing ports to their latest versions and hunted down a bug
in the 9-CURRENT rtld which was causing GHC to crash intermittently. We
also started work on Haskell Platform 2011.3.0.0 (development version)
in a `separate git branch in our development
repository <https://github.com/freebsd-haskell/freebsd-haskell/tree/haskell-platform-2011.3.0.0>`__.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test GHC to work with clang/LLVM.
#. Add an option to the GHC port to be able to build it with already
   installed GHC instead of requiring a separate GHC boostrap tarball.
#. Update Haskell Platform (along with GHC) to 2011.4.0.0 as soon as it
   gets out.
#. Add more ports to the Ports collection.

OpenAFS port

|  Contact: Derrick Brashear <shadow@gmail.com\ >

AFS is a distributed network filesystem that originated from the Andrew
Project at Carnegie-Mellon University. OpenAFS 1.6.0 has been released,
and is available in the FreeBSD Ports Collection; it is usable under
light load, but heavy usage reveals some issues that remain unresolved.
The OpenAFS kernel module is now built using the bsd.kmod.mk
infrastructure on the git master branch; unfortunately this change
required a minor change in the OS-independent Makefiles and could not be
merged in time for 1.6.0. Some attention has been given to memory leaks,
but only one small leak has been patched so far.

There are several known outstanding issues that are being worked on, but
detailed bug reports are welcome at port-freebsd@openafs.org.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Update VFS locking to allow the use of disk-based client caches as
   well as memory-based caches.
#. Track down races and deadlocks that may appear under load.
#. Eliminate a moderate memory leak from the kernel module.
#. PAG (Process Authentication Group) support is not functional.

Portmaster
----------

URL: http://dougbarton.us/portmaster-proposal.html

Contact: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org\ >

Portmaster offers several new features since the last quarterly update;
some bug fixes for the package installation code, and various internal
optimizations. The most exciting new feature is probably the ability to
specify the -r option more than once for the same portmaster run. This
greatly increases efficiency when several "branch" and/or "trunk" ports
need updates at the same time, especially for package-building systems.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Splitting out the fetch code is still "on the list" of work to be
   done, but it was sidetracked by other priorities in the past months.
   I hope to complete it in the quarter to come.
#. Another new feature in the works is support for a list of files for
   portmaster to preserve and restore during upgrades of a port.

The purpose of this one-day event was to gather Central European
developers of today's open-source BSD systems to popularize their work
and their organizations, and to meet each other in the real life. We
wanted to motivate potential future developers and users, especially
undergraduate university students, to work with BSD systems.

This year's BSD-Day was held in Bratislava, Slovakia at the Slovak
University of Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and
Information Technology on November 5, 2011.

The 10th anniversary European BSD Conference was organized in Maarssen,
The Netherlands with more than 250 registered visitors. There were many
interesting tutorials, including introductions to DTrace and working
with Netgraph. It featured 26 high-quality talks and 2 keynote speakers
on various topics related to FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, or even MINIX:
OpenBSD PF, NetBSD NPF, IPv6 support in FreeBSD, virtualization in the
BSD domain, recent developments in OpenSSH, exploration of the recent
FreeNAS, system management with ZFS, practical capabilities for UNIX
known as Capsicum.

It also had a dedicated track for the attendees of the FreeBSD developer
summit, where one could learn more about what is happening currently in
the Project. We had presentations on the new package management
solution, Google Summer of Code 2011, a stacked cryptographic file
system, conversion of documents of different formats, and status reports
on the sparc64 port and the NAND flash support.

FreeBSD Developer Summit, Maarssen
----------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/201110DevSummit

Contact: Gabor Pali <pgj@FreeBSD.org\ >

We had 60 FreeBSD developers and invited guests attending the FreeBSD
Developer Summit organized as part of EuroBSDcon 2011 in Maarssen, The
Netherlands. This year EuroBSDcon organizers offered us their generous
support in handling the details, like registrations, renting the venue,
and providing food for keeping attendees happy.

The Maarssen developer summit spanned over 3 days. It is generally a
workshop-style event that has now adopted the layout of the developer
summit organized successfully in Canada earlier in May. On the first
day, there were working groups on various topics, e.g. Capsicum,
toolchain issues, ports, and documentation. On the second day, there
were various plenary discussions, like how FreeBSD relates to
virtualization or how vendors relate to FreeBSD. Finally, on the third
day, there were many interesting work-in-progress reports given in a
dedicated developer summit track at the main conference.

Photos and slides for the most of the talks are available on the home
page of the summit.

Multibyte Encoding Support in Nvi
---------------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/ZhihaoSoC2011
|  URL: https://github.com/lichray/nvi2

Contact: Zhihao Yuan <lichray@gmail.com\ >

nvi-iconv keeps the behaviors and the license of nvi-1.79 in the base
system and adopts the multibyte encoding support from nvi-1.8x.

Status:

-  Known memory leaks, bugs are fixed. make buildworld clear, under
   WARNS=1 (the old one was WARNS=0).
-  UTF-16 is supported with less hacks.
-  The 'windowname' option now restores the xterm title through xprop.
-  The file encoding detection modified from file(1) is finished and
   considered stable. The detection is always on as nvi-iconv never
   changes the actual encoding, and the detection falls back to locale.
-  Pavel Timofeev provided a full Russian translation of the catalog.
   Thanks to him.
-  Now nvi-iconv is able to be compiled with widechar only and without
   iconv (inspired by a user on FreeBSDChina.org). In that case, it only
   supports your locale.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. The wide character support in nvi's message (feedback over the last
   line) system.
#. Collect more testing results and get code review.
