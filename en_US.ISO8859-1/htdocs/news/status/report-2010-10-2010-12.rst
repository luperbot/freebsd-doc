BSDInstall
----------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/BSDInstall

Contact: Nathan Whitehorn <nwhitehorn@FreeBSD.org\ >

BSDInstall is a replacement for the venerable sysinstall installer. It
is designed to be modular and easily extensible, while being fully
scriptable and streamlining the installation process. It is mostly
complete, and installs working systems on i386, amd64, sparc64, powerpc,
and powerpc64, with untested PC98 support.

New Features:

-  Allows installation onto GPT disks on x86 systems
-  Can do installations spanning multiple disks
-  Allows installation into jails
-  Eases PXE installation
-  Virtualization friendly: can install from a live system onto disk
   images
-  Works on PowerPC
-  Streamlined system installation
-  More flexible scripting
-  Easily tweakable
-  All install CDs are live CDs

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Wireless networking configuration wizard.
#. ZFS installation support.
#. Itanium disk setup.

--------------

Non-executable Stacks
---------------------

Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org\ >

The support for non-executable stacks, using the approach identical to
one used by GNU toolchain and Linux'es, is implemented for amd64 and
PowerPC. The support is already committed to HEAD. For now,
non-executable stacks are turned off by default.

I plan to provide a detailed information to ports@ and switch the knob
after port tree is unfrozed for 7.4/8.2 releases.

--------------

Webcamd
-------

| URL: http://www.selasky.org/hans_petter/video4bsd
|  URL: http://www.freshports.org/multimedia/webcamd/

Contact: Hans Petter Selasky <hselasky@FreeBSD.org\ >

Webcamd is a small daemon that enables about 1500 different USB based
webcam, DVB and remote control USB devices under the FreeBSD-8.0 and
later operating system. The webcam daemon is basically an application
which is a port of Video4Linux USB drivers into userspace on FreeBSD.
The daemon currently depends on libc, pthreads, libusb and libcuse4bsd.

During Q3 2010 webcamd got manpages thanks to Dru Lavigne.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. I hope to get a Google summer of code project this year building the
   default Linux Kernel 2.6.37+ and allowing use of relevant Linux USB
   device drivers under FreeBSD. Webcamd is not a replacement for native
   FreeBSD kernel drivers and will only be used when no existing FreeBSD
   drivers exist for a given device staying clear of any GPLv2 issues.
   If you are a student and/or is interested in participating in such a
   project feel free to send an e-mail to hselasky@FreeBSD.org.

--------------

xz Compression for Packages and Log Files
-----------------------------------------

Contact: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org\ >

Creating and processing xz-compressed packages is now supported by
pkg\_create(1), pkg\_add(1) and bsdtar(1) in both 9-CURRENT and
8-STABLE. Users can test working with .txz packages by adding
"PKG\_SUFX=.txz" into /etc/make.conf.

The ports-mgmt/portupgrade utility supports .txz packages from version
2.4.8 and a patch for ports-mgmt/portmaster has been submitted but not
yet accepted by the author.

A patch for newsyslog(8) with a rewrite of the use of compression tools
supporting xz compression is under maintainer review.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Import xz(1) compression support into newsyslog(8).
#. Add .txz package support to ports-mgmt/portmaster.
#. Add .txz package support to the FreeBSD port building cluster
   (pointyhat).
#. Test building all packages in .txz format and compare results with
   .tbz.

--------------

ZFS pool version 28
-------------------

| URL:
  http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-fs/2010-December/010292.html
|  URL:
  http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-fs/2010-December/010321.html

| Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org\ >

A new version of the ZFS pool v28 patch was released for testing, this
time for 9-CURRENT and 8-STABLE. Compared to the previous patch it does
include updated boot support, improved sendfile(2) handling, a
compatibility layer with older ZFS and several other bugfixes.

If there are no major issues we can expect ZFS v28 imported into the
FreeBSD-CURRENT after 8.2 is released.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Import of ZFS v28 into FreeBSD-CURRENT.

FreeBSD Bugbusting Team Status Report
-------------------------------------

| URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#gnats
|  URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/BugBusting
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/studies/prs/

| Contact: Gavin Atkinson <gavin@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Remko Lodder <remko@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Volker Werth <vwe@FreeBSD.org\ >

The number of non-ports PRs has held relatively steady over the last
three months, with a slightly improved resolution rate being offset by a
slightly increased rate of new arrivals. Ports PRs have increased
slightly in numbers, due in part to the ports freeze in the lead up to
the release of FreeBSD 7.4 and FreeBSD 8.2. The numbers traditionally
drop quickly again once the freeze is lifted.

In October, Gavin Atkinson and Mark Linimon held a session at the
FreeBSD Developers' Summit at EuroBSDCon, which led to some productive
discussions, and a number of people expressing interest in becoming more
involved with PR triaging and resolution.

The bugbusting team continue work on trying to make the contents of the
GNATS PR database cleaner, more accessible and easier for committers to
find and resolve PRs, by tagging PRs to indicate the areas involved, and
by ensuring that there is sufficient info within each PR to resolve each
issue.

Reports continue to be produced from the PR database, all of which can
be found from the links above. Committers interested in custom reports
are encouraged to discuss requirements with bugmeister@ - we are happy
to create new reports where needs are identified.

As always, anybody interested in helping out with the PR queue is
encouraged to do so, the easiest way being to join us on IRC in
#freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet. We are always looking for additional help,
whether your interests lie in triaging incoming PRs, generating patches
to resolve existing problems, or simply helping with the database
housekeeping (identifying duplicate PRs, ones that have already been
resolved, etc). This is a great way of getting more involved with
FreeBSD!

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs
   that the team has already analyzed.
#. Try to get more non-committers involved with the triaging of PRs as
   they come in, and generating patches to fix reported problems.

Release Engineering Team Status Report
--------------------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Contact: Release Engineering Team <re@FreeBSD.org\ >

The Release Engineering Team reports the joint release of FreeBSD 7.4
and 8.2 has been delayed slightly but should be completed within a week
or two of the original schedule:
http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/7.4R/schedule.html
http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/8.2R/schedule.html

--------------

The FreeBSD Foundation Status Report
------------------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org\ >

We raised $325,000 towards our goal of $350,000 for 2010! This will
allow us to increase our project development and equipment spending for
2011.

We were proud to be a sponsor for EuroBSDCon 2010, BSDDay Argentina
2010, MeetBSD California 2010, and NYBSDCon 2010.

Completed the Foundation funded projects: DAHDI Project by Max Khon and
BSNMP Improvements by Shteryana Sotirova.

We kicked off a new project by the University of Melbourne called
Feed-Forward Clock Synchronization Algorithms Project. The Five New TCP
Congestion Control Algorithms for FreeBSD Project by Swinburne
University also officially started.

We continued our work on infrastructure projects to beef up hardware for
package-building, network-testing, etc. This includes purchasing
equipment as well as managing equipment donations.

Stop by and visit with us at FOSDEM (Feb 5-6), SCALE (Feb 26),
AsiaBSDCon (March 17-20), and Indiana Linuxfest (March 26).

Read more about how we supported the project and community by reading
our end-of-year newsletter at:

DIstributed Firewall and Flow-shaper Using Statistical Evidence (DIFFUSE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/
|  URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/downloads.html

| Contact: Sebastian Zander <szander@swin.edu.au\ >
|  Contact: Grenville Armitage <garmitage@swin.edu.au\ >

DIFFUSE is a system enabling FreeBSD's IPFW firewall subsystem to
classify IP traffic based on statistical traffic properties.

With DIFFUSE, IPFW computes statistics (such as packet lengths or
inter-packet time intervals) for observed flows, and uses ML (machine
learning) techniques to assign flows into classes. In addition to
traditional packet inspection rules, IPFW rules may now also be
expressed in terms of traffic statistics or classes identified by ML
classification. This can be helpful when direct packet inspection is
problematic (perhaps for administrative reasons, or because port numbers
do not reliably identify applications).

DIFFUSE also enables one instance of IPFW to send flow information and
classes to other IPFW instances, which then can act on such traffic
(e.g. prioritise, accept, deny, etc) according to its class. This allows
for distributed architectures, where classification at one location in
your network is used to control fire-walling or rate-shaping actions at
other locations.

In December 2010 we released DIFFUSE v0.1, a set of patches for
FreeBSD-CURRENT. It can be downloaded from the project's web site. The
web site also contains a more comprehensive introduction, including
application examples, links to related work and documentation describing
the software design.

We hope to release DIFFUSE v0.2 soon. Keep an eye on the freebsd-ipfw
and freebsd-net mailing lists for project-related announcements.

--------------

Ethernet Switch Framework
-------------------------

URL: http://loos.no-ip.org/rspro/switch-1.diff

Contact: Luiz Otavio O. Souza <loos.br@gmail.com\ >

Implementation of a framework for ethernet switch control (directly
connected to the ethernet MAC controller) usually found on embedded
systems. Currently based on ifconfig keywords, adds the vlan control
(filter/pass) on each switch port and adds the possibility for the
management of media state on interfaces with multiple PHYs.

Currently, the code supports the IP175D (from some mikrotik
routerboards) and AR8316 (from Ubiquiti RSPRO) switches.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Finish the IP175C driver (and maybe IP178x).
#. Better integration with miibus (rewrite of switchbus).
#. Fix (some) ifconfig keywords (better keywords, better usage
   compatibility).
#. Export the ports statistics through SNMP (if available on switch
   chip).
#. Add a swctl tool (?) for global settings management.
#. Write usage examples and the man page information about the new
   ifconfig(8) keywords.

Five New TCP Congestion Control Algorithms for FreeBSD
------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/freebsd/5cc/
|  URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/newtcp/
|  URL: http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/projects.shtml
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~lstewart/patches/5cc/

| Contact: David Hayes <dahayes@swin.edu.au\ >

|  Contact: Grenville Armitage <garmitage@swin.edu.au\ >
|  Contact: Rui Paulo <rpaulo@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Bjoern Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org\ >

The project is nearing completion, with the following code already
available in the svn head branch:

-  Modular congestion control framework.
-  Modularised implementations of NewReno, CUBIC and HTCP congestion
   control algorithms.
-  Khelp (Kernel Helper) and Hhook (Helper Hook) frameworks.
-  Basic Khelp/Hhook integration with the TCP stack.

The ERTT (Enhanced Round Trip Time) Khelp module is days away from being
imported, which will then pave the way for the delay based congestion
control algorithms to follow. Finally, a large documentation dump will
be committed in the form of new and updated man pages.

We anticipate the project will conclude around the end of January 2011.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Import the ERTT Khelp module.
#. Import the VEGAS, HD and CHD delay based congestion control algorithm
   modules.
#. Import the documentation dump for all the code contributed/developed
   as part of the project.

FreeBSD 802.11n
---------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/AdrianChadd/AtherosStuff

Contact: Adrian Chadd <adrian@FreeBSD.org\ >

-  Net80211 station mode works in 2.4ghz HT/20 mode. HT/40 and 5ghz do
   not currently work.
-  Basic 802.11 TX and RX on the AR9160 works, from MCS0 to MCS15
-  TX A-MPDU and A-MSDU do not currently implemented - so no aggregate
   TX will happen
-  RX A-MPDU and A-MSDU is implemented and is supposed to work but does
   not — this needs to be debugged
-  802.11n RTS/CTS protection for legacy packets does not currently
   work. There is some magic required to fix the TX packet length. This
   is in progress.
-  WPA2 now works - a commit which enabled the hardware multicast broke
   AES-CCMP encryption on at least the AR9160. Further investigation is
   needed to fix this (and any other hardware encryption bugs that are
   lurking.

FreeBSD VirtIO Network Driver
-----------------------------

| URL: http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio
|  URL:
  http://lists.FreeBSD.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2011-January/022036.html

Contact: Bryan V. <deboomerang@gmail.com\ >

VirtIO is a device framework offered by KVM/Qemu and Virtualbox to allow
guests to achieve better I/O performance. A beta network driver was made
available earlier this month, and work continues on completing the block
device and refinements the existing network driver.

Generic IEEE 802.3 annex 31B full duplex flow control support for Ethernet in mii(4)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_flow_control

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org\ >

In r213878 a NetBSD-compatible mii\_attach() was added to mii(4) as an
replacement for mii\_phy\_probe() and subsequently all Ethernet device
drivers in the tree which use this framework were converted to take
advantage of the former. This allowed to considerably clean up mii(4) as
well as the converted MAC and PHY drivers and get rid of quite a few
hacks, amongst others the infamous "EVIL HACK". However, the main
motivation of this change was to allow the addition of generic IEEE
802.3 annex 31B full duplex flow control support to mii(4), which was
ported from NetBSD but also enhanced and fixed quite a bit and committed
in r215297. Along with this bge(4), bce(4), msk(4), nfe(4) and stge(4)
as well as brgphy(4), e1000phy(4) and ip1000phy(4), which previously all
implemented their own flow control support based on mostly undocumented
special media flags separately, were converted to take advantage of the
generic support. At least for CURRENT this means that these drivers now
no longer unconditionally advertise support for flow control but only do
so if flow control was selected as media option. The reason for
implementing the generic flow control support that way was to allow it
to be switched on and off via ifconfig(8) with the PHY specific default
to typically being off in order to protect from unwanted effects.
Subsequently support for flow control based on the generic support was
added to alc(4), fxp(4), cas(4), gem(4), jme(4), re(4) and xl(4) as well
as atphy(4), bmtphy(4), gentbi(4), inphy(4), jmphy(4), nsgphy(4),
nsphyter(4) and rgephy(4). For several of the remaining Ethernet drivers
it also would only require minor changes to enable flow control support
if supported by the respective MAC. Due to the fact that each
implementation should be thoroughly tested and tuned this was only done
for drivers were hardware was available though.

An example for identifying support for flow control based on the generic
implementation in the dmesg-output for a certain MAC-PHY-combination
would be:

    bge0: <Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet Controller, ASIC rev.
    0x002003> mem 0 xfe010000-0xfe01ffff,0xfe000000-0xfe00ffff irq 25 at
    device 2.0 on pci2
     bge0: CHIP ID 0x00002003; ASIC REV 0x02; CHIP REV 0x20; PCI-X
     miibus0: <MII bus> on bge0
     brgphy0: <BCM5704 10/100/1000baseTX PHY> PHY 1 on miibus0
     brgphy0: 10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, 1000baseT,
    1000baseT-master, 1000baseT-FDX, 1000baseT-FDX-master, auto,
    **auto-flow**

or in the output of ifconfig -m for a given device:

    supported media:

        media autoselect *mediaopt flowcontrol*

The latter also is what one would use to enable flow control for such a
device, i.e.:

    ifconfig bge0 media autoselect mediaopt flowcontrol

or in order to turn it off again:

    ifconfig bge0 media autoselect -mediaopt flowcontrol

Note that some PHY drivers, currently only rgephy(4) though, also
support enabling flow control support when using manual media
configuration like in the following example:

    ifconfig re0 media autoselect mediaopt full-fuplex,flowcontrol

In CURRENT this can also be further abbreviated (support for this will
eventually be merged back into the supported stable branch(es) but not
be present in 7.4-RELEASE or 8.2-RELEASE) as:

    ifconfig re0 media auto mediaopt fdx,flow

For a device which has successfully negotiated flow control support with
its link partner will report it in the output of ifconfig along with the
available directions like in the following example:

    media: Ethernet autoselect <flowcontrol> (100baseTX <full-duplex,
    *flowcontrol,rxpause,txpause*>)

Another thing that was introduced with r215297 was generic support for
setting 1000baseT master mode via a media option when using manual media
configuration. Consequently, brgphy(4), ciphy(4), e1000phy(4) as well as
ip1000phy(4) have been converted to take advantage of this generic
support. At least for CURRENT this means that these drivers now no
longer take the link0 parameter for selecting master mode but the master
media option has to be used instead like in the following example:

    ifconfig bge0 media 1000baseT mediaopt full-duplex,master

Selection of master mode now is also available with all other PHY
drivers supporting 1000baseT.

With the exception of the media option abbreviations all of the above
mentioned changes were merged into 7-STABLE in r215879 and into 8-STABLE
in r215881 respectively. This means that they will be part of
7.4-RELEASE and 8.2-RELEASE. In order to no break POLA, unlike as in
CURRENT bge(4), bce(4), msk(4), nfe(4) and stge(4) were changed to
continue to always advertise support of flow control to their link
partners in these stable branches with no way to turn that off as they
also did before with their custom implementations. Additionally,
brgphy(4), ciphy(4), e1000phy(4) as well as ip1000phy(4) were changed to
still also accept the link0 parameter in addition to the master media
option for setting master mode.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. We actually miserably fail to properly document the available media
   types and options in manual pages. For example several of the media
   lists in manual pages of MAC drivers like bge(4) already were
   outdated and with the addition of generic flow control and 1000baseT
   master mode support these are now even more outdated. Yet worse is
   the fact that for MAC drivers which use the mii(4) framework it is
   technically just plain wrong to include these lists in their manual
   page as the PHY drivers actually are responsible for handling the
   media types and options. However, given that the PHY drivers
   determine the available media types and options mostly dynamically at
   run-time it generally makes no sense to have static documentation of
   these in their manual pages (apart from the fact that we currently
   have no manual pages for PHY drivers). One good way out of this
   should be to replace the media lists in MAC drivers using mii(4) with
   just a note to check the output of ifconfig -m to get a list of the
   media types and options actually supported by a given device and to
   add a generic ifmedia(4) manual page which provides some general
   background information about media types and options similar to what
   NetBSD and OpenBSD also have.

During the last quarter a lot of work was spent on quality time hunting
down and fixing open bugs and races in the network stack, mostly IPv6,
as well as testing and getting virtualized network stack parts more
stable. Tests for the pf(4) firewall update were started with VIMAGE. In
addition Viagenie's NAT64 patch was ported over.

TCP SMP scalability project
---------------------------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org\ >

A long-running TCP SMP scalability project is beginning to wrap up, with
the goal of committing a large outstanding patch to the FreeBSD 9.x tree
in the next month. This work implements a derivative of Willman, Rixner,
and Cox's TCP connection group model, blended with support for hardware
load distribution features in contemporary NICs (including RSS).
Additional software distribution support can do work redistribution
based on new notions of CPU affinity for individual TCP connections.

On-going work is refining performance on non-RSS supporting
configurations, and adding APIs to allow socket affinity to be queried
(and where supported) set by applications. These changes significantly
improve network scalability by reducing global lock contention,
encouraging CPU affinity for connections, and avoiding cache line
contention. The goal is to allow steady-state TCP connections to use
only CPU-local cache lines, with work distributed to all CPUs. Current
performance results are extremely promising.

This project has been sponsored by Juniper Networks.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Allow the hash model to be selected at boot-time or run-time rather
   than compile-time; currently "options RSS" enables RSS support
   unconditionally — for systems without RSS NICs, this leads to a small
   one-time performance penalty at the creation of each call to bind()
   or connect().
#. Add missing socket options to query (and override) default CPU
   affinity for connections, which is derived from the active software
   or hardware hash model.
#. Teach the network stack and appropriate NIC drivers to propagate
   software-overridden connection affinity to hardware using new device
   driver ioctls for managing TCAMs and hardware hash tables.
#. Refine software redistribution of work in the event that there are
   fewer hardware queues than available CPU threads in which to process
   packets; the current prototype is able to do this with significant
   performance benefits, but the model requires refining.
#. Experiment with (and measure) software work redistribution at
   run-time based on RSS bucket rearrangement. This will require a new
   event notification to device drivers so that they can update hardware
   caches of the network stack's authoritative table.
#. Commit.

Resource Containers
-------------------

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org\ >

The goal of this project is to implement resource containers and a
per-jail resource limits mechanism, so that system administrators can
partition resources like memory or CPU between jails and prevent users
from DoS-ing the whole system. Project is close to completion. One big
item that needs to be fixed before releasing a patch for people to test
is %CPU accounting; initial idea of just using %CPU calculated by the
scheduler turned out to be useless. Implementing it cleanly will also
make it easier to support other similar resources (e.g.
writes-per-second) in the future.

--------------

SYSCTL Type Safety
------------------

Contact: Matthew Fleming <mdf@FreeBSD.org\ >

I started upstreaming a patch from Isilon that adds type-checking to the
various SYSCTL\_FOO and SYSCTL\_ADD\_FOO macros for various scalar
types, which has turned into quite the discussion on the src mailing
list. The type-checking macros are committed to sys/sysctl.h but under
#if 0.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. As of right now, it looks like I will be rolling a new sysctl macro
   for the kernel that detects they type at compile time and does the
   Right Thing. Existing uses of the legacy SYSCTL\_FOO and
   SYSCTL\_ADD\_FOO for scalar types can be replaced, and will probably
   turn into invocations of the new interface via preprocessor macro.

TRIM support for UFS
--------------------

| Contact: Kirk McKusick <mckusick@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org\ >

TRIM support for UFS is implemented in HEAD. Potentially, this may
increase the steady speed and longevity of SSDs.

Due to concerns with the speed of TRIM operations on many SSDs, and not
a lot of experience with the real-world behaviour, the support is off by
default, and should be enabled on the per-filesystem basis.

Kristaps' groff-replacement (only for rendering manual pages) is already
available in NetBSD and OpenBSD, and used to render the base system
manpages for the latter. This project aims to do similar things for
FreeBSD. Since the last status report, mdocml has grown rudimentary
tbl(1) support and a whole lot of bugfixes have gone in. A groff port
has been created and needs some more testing before it can be committed
to the tree. Also the WITHOUT\_GROFF support in base has been fleshed
out and is awaiting review before commit.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Get ru@ to review WITHOUT\_GROFF changes.

The committers to the German Documentation Project managed to update the
German documentation just in time to get the changes included into the
next FreeBSD releases. The website translations were also kept in sync
with the ones on FreeBSD.org.

We tried to re-activate committers who did not contribute for some time
but most of them are currently unable to free up enough time. We hope to
gain fresh contributor blood as we are getting occasional reports about
bugs and grammar in the german translation.

FreeBSD Services Control (fsc)
------------------------------

Contact: Tom Rhodes <trhodes@FreeBSD.org\ >

FreeBSD Services Control is a mix of binaries which integrate into the
rc.d system and provide for service (daemon) monitoring. It knows about
signals, pidfiles, and uses very little resources.

The fscd utilities will be set up as a port and, hopefully, dropped into
the ports collection in the coming weeks. This will allow easier testing
by everyone and it should make migration into -CURRENT much easier.

GEOM-based ataraid(4) Replacement — geom\_raid

| Contact: Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: M. Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org\ >

New project started to create GEOM-based replacement for ataraid(4) —
software RAID, that will be obsoleted by migration to the new CAM-based
ATA implementation.

This implementation planned with accent to modular design, that includes
common core and two sets of modules, handling data transformations (RAID
levels) and on-disk metadata formats specifics. Such design should make
further extension easier.

At this moment work focused around RAID0/RAID1 transformations and Intel
metadata format. Module is now able to read, write and create Intel
volumes. Error recovery and rebuild work is now in progress. Support for
other RAID levels and metadata formats, supported by ataraid(4), planned
later.

This project is sponsored by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Complete error recovery/rebuild work and stabilize modules API.
#. Implement metadata modules for other formats.
#. Implement transformation modules for other RAID levels.

gpart Improvements
------------------

Contact: Andrey V. Elsukov <ae@FreeBSD.org\ >

GEOM class PART is the default disk partitioning class since FreeBSD
8.0. Compared to 8.1 now it does have several new features: Partition
resizing. New "gpart resize" subcommand was implemented for all
partitioning schemes but EBR. GPT recovering. Guid Partition Table does
have redundant metadata and it can be recovered when some of them is
damaged. New "gpart recover" subcommand was implemented for that
purpose. Ability to backup/restore of partition table. New "gpart
backup" and "gpart restore" subcommands were implemented.

FreeBSD on the Playstation 3
----------------------------

Contact: Nathan Whitehorn <nwhitehorn@FreeBSD.org\ >

On January 5, support for the Playstation 3 was imported into FreeBSD
9.0-CURRENT. This port is still somewhat raw (only netbooting is
supported, no access to the SPUs, etc.), but hardware support should be
more fleshed out by the time FreeBSD 9.0 is released. The port uses the
OtherOS mechanism, and so requires a "fat" console with firmware earlier
than 3.21.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. SATA driver.
#. Sound support.
#. SPU driver.

FreeBSD/sparc64
---------------

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org\ >

CPUTYPE support for sparc64 has been added to CURRENT in r216820. The
three flavors currently supported are "ultrasparc", "ultrasparc3" and
"v9". So it is now possible to let the compiler produce code optimize
for the family of UltraSPARC-III CPUs by setting CPUTYPE to
"ultrasparc3". Setting it to "ultrasparc" as well as omitting it
completely optimizes for UltraSPARC-I/II family CPUs as before. Support
for generating generic 64-bit V9 code was mainly added for reference
purposes. As it turned out, at least for SPARC64-V CPUs running code
optimized for UltraSPARC-III CPUs does not perform measurably better
than UltraSPARC-I/II one though so the default is just fine for these.
This change was merged into 7-STABLE in r217005 and into 8-STABLE in
r217004 respectively, neither 7.4-RELEASE nor 8.2-RELEASE will include
it though.

Support for a certain feature available with UltraSPARC-III+ and
greater, i.e. with all sun4u CPUs following the original UltraSPARC-III,
has been added to CURRENT in r216803. The net effect of this change is
that we now can use a kernel TSB and thus a kernel address space of
virtually any size up to the full 64-bit address space on machines
equipped with these CPUs, apart from the fact that 1GB of address space
still takes up 4MB worth of data structures. Before, the theoretical
limit was 16GB due to the fact that the MMUs of these UltraSPARC CPUs
only have 16 lockable TLB slots (UltraSPARC-I/II have 64 and SPARC64
CPUs again have at least 32), with the actual limit being several GB
below that because we need some of these slots also for mapping the
PROM, the kernel itself and in MP-systems the per-CPU page. Currently,
the kernel TSB and thus the kernel virtual address space is now always
sized one time the physical memory present in these machines with the
plan being to actually allow to it extend beyond the size of the RAM as
this helps especially ZFS. Most of this is implemented by patching the
instructions used to access the kernel TSB based on the CPU present, so
the run-time overhead of this change is rather low. Once it is also
enabled and successfully tested with SPARC64 CPUs this change will be
merged back into the supported stable branch(es).

Theoretically it should be also possible to use the same approach for
the user TSB, which already is not locked into the TLB but can cause
nested traps. However, for reasons I do not understand yet, OpenSolaris
only does this with SPARC64 CPUs. On the other hand I think that also
using it for the user TSB and thus avoiding nested traps would get us
closer to running the FreeBSD/sparc64 code on machines equipped with
sun4v CPUs, which only supports trap level 0 and 1, too, so eventually
we could have a single kernel which runs on both sun4u and sun4v
machines (as does Linux and OpenBSD).

Work on adding support for Sun Fire 3800 and similar models has begun
but still is in its early stages.

We are working on updating the Chromium web browser in our ports to stay

Chromium 9 beta running, but not all features are fully implemented and
the port still needs some polish before it can be committed to the Ports
Collection. We have also been making arrangements with Google to merge
our work with their upstream, which should ease the number of features
and fixes we have to maintain for ourselves in the future. Our first
release should be in a few weeks and coincide with the official release

Portmaster

Contact: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org\ >

Portmaster version 3.6.1 is now in the ports tree, and the emphasis in
the last year has been on improving the stability and performance of
existing features, with a few new features sprinkled in. A lot of work
has gone into error handling, both for unexpected states in the ports
system and for user input. For example, all prompts are now wrapped in
code to verify that what was entered was one of the valid options.

Perhaps the most interesting new element is that for the features -e,
-s, --clean-distfiles, --clean-packages, --check-depends and
--check-port-dbdir you can now specify either -y or -n to automatically
provide the corresponding answer to the yes/no questions. The -o, -r,
and --index-only options have received major overhauls, and now either
work better or at least as advertised.

There has also been a lot of work put into reducing the memory
footprint, especially in the environment variables that are shared
between the parent and child processes. And for those operating without
a local ports tree (--index-only/--packages-only) all of the features
that *can* work without the ports tree now do.

Significant support for the upgrading of operating without a ports tree
was provided by GridFury, LLC. Their support, as well as the support
received from other members of the community continues to be greatly
appreciated.

Bigbluebutton has joined the list of ready to run applications in the
ports tree. Dru Lavigne has been instrumental on getting it to run, as
well as offering suggestions for improvements to the port.

smb4k was updated to the latest release version, which requires kde4.
This was enough of a change that a new port was created, net/smb4k-kde4.
the initial port went through a number of quick changes, including a
patch to the source code to fix a FreeBSD source code submitted by
PC-BSD's Kris Moore. This application greatly eases the task of working
with samba shares in a FreeBSD environment.

Freeswitch is the result of 3 Asterisk developers working on a VoIP
package that fulfills their goals. They have switched away from a
release model to a "just run latest SVN checkout" model. With the help
of Richard Neese and Eric Crist, static snapshots of their SVN repo have
been taken, the port has been modified to use the newer version, and
extensive build and run testing has been done.

In Q4 we added 2 new committers, took in 2 commit bit for safe keeping,
and welcomed back 4 returning committers.

The Ports Management team bid farewell to Kris Kennaway in November
2010. Kris was the root of krismail, the mail we all got from time to
time when ports broke on pointyhat. Kris did a lot of work benchmarking
and testing FreeBSD for stability, scalability and usability.

Mark Linimon has put a lot of effort into refactoring and refining the
code that runs the 'pointyhat' package build dispatch system. In 2010,
the FreeBSD Foundation purchased for portmgr a pair of new machines,
pointyhat-west and pointyhat-east, to take over from the existing
machine. (The new machines have much greater RAM, CPU, and disk
capacity.) However, to properly utilize them, the existing code needed
to be generalized.

Persistent bugs, and some hardware troubles, have delayed the rollout
far beyond what was originally planned, but there appears to be light at
the end of the tunnel. (And, this time, it does not appear to be an
oncoming train.)

A document entitled "Mentoring Guidelines" as been circulated among
