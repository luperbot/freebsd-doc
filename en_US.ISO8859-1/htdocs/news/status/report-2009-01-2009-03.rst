Introduction
============

Since the last Status Reports there has been interesting progress in
FreeBSD Development. FreeBSD 7.2 was released just a few days ago. Some
of the highlights include: Support for superpages in the FreeBSD Virtual
Memory subsystem. The FreeBSD Kernel Virtual Address space has been
increased to 6GB on amd64. An updated jail(8) subsystem that supports
multi-IPv4/IPv6/noIP and much more. Lots of FreeBSD Developers are in
Ottawa, Canada attending the FreeBSD Developer Summit that is before
BSDCan. BSDCan officially starts tomorrow and should cover lots of
interesting topics, see the `BSDCan
Website <http://www.bsdcan.org/2009/>`__ for more information.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
reading.

Clang replacing GCC in the base system
--------------------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/BuildingFreeBSDWithClang
|  URL: http://git.hoeg.nl/?p=llvm-bmake
|  URL: http://clang.llvm.org/

| Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Pawel Worach <pawel.worach@gmail.com\ >

The last 3-4 months we've been working together with the LLVM developers
to discuss any bugs and issues we are experiencing with their Clang
compiler frontend. The FreeBSD project is looking at the possibility to
replace GCC with Clang as a system compiler. It can compile 99% of the
FreeBSD world and can compile booting kernel on i386/amd64 but it still
contains bugs and its C++ support is still immature.

Ed is maintaining a patchset for the FreeBSD sources to replace cc(1) by
a Clang binary and bootstrap almost all sources with the Clang compiler.

The LLVM developers are very helpful fixing most of the bugs we've
reported (over 100). Unfortunately we are currently blocked on some bug
reports that prevent us from building libc, libm, libcrypto and various
CDDL libraries with Clang but the FreeBSD kernel itself compiles and
boots.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Testing Clang with compilation of various applications and reporting
   bugs.
#. Testing the llvm-bmake branch to find more bugs.
#. Arranging an experimental ports build.

--------------

Device mmap() Extensions
------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/~jhb/pat/

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org\ >

GPU device drivers are increasingly requiring more sophisticated support
for mapping objects into both userland and the kernel. For example,
memory used for textures often needs to be mapped Write-Combining rather
than Write-Back. I have recently created three patches to provide
several extensions.

The first patch allows device drivers to use a different VM object to
back specific mmap() calls instead of always using the device pager. The
second patch introduces a new VM object type that can map an arbitrary
set of physical address ranges. This can be used to let userland mmap
PCI BARs, etc. The third patch allows memory mappings to use different
caching modes (e.g. Write-Combining or Uncacheable).

Together I believe these patches provide the remaining pieces needed for
an Nvidia amd64 driver. They will also be useful for future Xorg DRM
support as well. The current set of patches can be safely merged back to
7.x as well.

Currently I am waiting for review and feedback from several folks. I am
hopeful that these patches will be in HEAD soon, prior to the 8.0
freeze.

--------------

OpenBSM
-------

URL: http://www.openbsm.org/

| Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: TrustedBSD audit mailing list
  <trustedbsd-audit@TrustedBSD.org\ >

The TrustedBSD Project has now released OpenBSM 1.1, the second
production release of the OpenBSM code base. OpenBSM 1.1 has been merged
to FreeBSD 8-CURRENT, and will be merged to 7-STABLE before FreeBSD 7.3.
Major changes since OpenBSM 1.0 include:

-  Trail files now include the host where the trail is generated. Crash
   recovery has been improved. Trail expiration based on size and date
   is now supported; by default trail files will be expired after 10MB
   of trails. The default individual trail limit is now 2MB.
-  Mac OS X Snow Leopard is now a fully supported platform; launchd(8)
   can now be used to launchd auditd(8). Command line tools and
   libraries are now supported on Mac OS X Leopard.
-  Extended header tokens are now supported, allowing audit trails to be
   tagged with a host identifier. IPv6 addresses are now supported in
   subject tokens. BSM token and record types have been further
   synchronized to OpenSolaris; support for many new system calls has
   been added. Local errors and socket types are mapped to and from BSM
   values.

Since the last test release, OpenBSM 1.1 beta 1, 32/64-bit compatibility
has been fixed for the auditon(2) system call. A default "expire-after"
of 10MB is now set in audit\_control(5). Local fcntl(2) arguments are
now mapped to wire BSM versions using new APIs. The audit\_submit(3) man
page has been fixed. A new audit event class has been added for
post-login authentication and access control events.
Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Migrate to sbufs in token-encoding.
#. Support for auditing NFS RPCs.

--------------

Release Engineering
-------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Contact: Release Engineering Team <re@FreeBSD.org\ >

The Release Engineering Team (with lots of help from lots of other
people) released FreeBSD 7.2 on May 4th, 2009. During this period we
have also begun reminding developers of the upcoming FreeBSD 8.0 release
cycle which is scheduled to begin in early June 2009 with release
targeted at early September 2009.

--------------

Sysinfo - a set of scripts which document your system
-----------------------------------------------------

| URL:
  http://danger.rulez.sk/index.php/2009/04/14/sysinfo-a-set-of-scripts-which-document-your-freebsd-system/
|  URL: https://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?p=19321

Contact: Daniel Gerzo <danger@FreeBSD.org\ >

*Sysinfo* is a shell script, the purpose of which is to automatically
gather system information and document the hardware and software
configuration of the given host system. The goal is to provide a system
operator with descriptive information about an unknown FreeBSD
installation.

It consists of several modules (also shell scripts), thus is easily
extensible and provides an easy way to inspect overall system
configuration.

It has been written as part of my Bachelor thesis and its development is
a work in progress. Therefore, I would appreciate if you could provide
me with some feedback as I will defend my thesis soon. Your feedback is
welcome at the
`forums <https://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?p=19321>`__ , or
alternatively you can send me a private email.

The tool itself can now be installed using the Ports tree from the
`sysutils/sysinfo <http://www.freshports.org/sysutils/sysinfo>`__ port.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Receive additional feedback.
#. Perform more testing.
#. Extend and improve the tool.

--------------

TrustedBSD MAC Framework in GENERIC
-----------------------------------

URL: http://www.trustedBSD.org/mac.html

| Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: TrustedBSD discussion mailing list
  <trustedbsd-discuss@TrustedBSD.org\ >

There is on-going work to allow "options MAC" to be included in the
GENERIC kernel for 8.0. This primarily consists of performance work to
reduce overhead when policies are used, and eliminate when none are
configured. Work to date includes:

-  The MAC Framework now detects which object types are labeled by
   policies, and MAC label storage is not allocated when it won't be
   used.
-  Add MAC Framework DTrace probes so allow more easy analysis of MAC
   Framework and policy interactions.
-  Eliminate mutex-protected reference count used to prevent module
   unload during entry point invocation, and replace with an sx lock and
   an rwlock, respectively for long-sleepable and short-sleepable entry
   points, significantly lowering the overhead of entering the MAC
   Framework. If no dynamic policies are loaded, no locking overhead is
   taken.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Move to rmlocks for non-sleepable entry points to reduce cache line
   thrashing under load.
#. Macroize invocation of MAC Framework entry points from the kernel,
   and perform caller-side determination of whether MAC is enabled in
   order to avoid additional function call overhead in the caller path
   if MAC is disabled.

--------------

VFS/NFS DTrace Probes
---------------------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org\ >

A new DTrace provider, dtnfsclient, has been added to the FreeBSD 8.x
kernel, and will be merged to 7.x before 7.3. The following probes are
available:

-  nfsclient:{nfs2,nfs3}:{procname}:start - NFSv2 and NFSv3 RPC start
   probes
-  nfsclient:{nfs2,nfs3}:{procname}:done - NFSv2 and NFSv3 RPC done
   probes
-  nfsclient:accesscache:: - NFS access cache flush/hit/miss/load probes
-  nfsclient:attrcache:: - NFS attribute cache flush/hit/miss/done

In addition, a number of VFS probes have been added:

-  vfs:vop:{vopname}:entry - VOP entry probe
-  vfs:vop:{vopname}:return - VOP return probe
-  vfs:namei:lookup:entry - VFS name lookup entry probe
-  vfs:namei:lookup:return - VFS name lookup return probe
-  vfs:namecache:\*:\* - VFS namecache
   enter/enter\_negative/fullpath\_enter/fullpath\_hit/fullpath\_miss/fullpath\_return/lookup\_hit/lookup\_hit\_negative/lookup\_miss/purge/purge\_negative/purgevfs/zap/zap\_negative
   probes

These probes make it much easier to trace NFS and VFS events.
Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Add VFSOP tracing.
#. Add RPC-layer tracing, such as RPC retransmits.
#. Provide decoded NFS RPCs in order to expose transaction IDs and file
   handles.

--------------

VirtualBox on FreeBSD

|  Contact: Martin Wilke <miwi@FreeBSD.org\ >

After the first mail from Alexander Eichner on the vbox-dev mailinglist,
we started the work on a VirtualBox port. 6 Days was needed to get
VirtualBox to start with over 20 patches. We'd like to say thanks to
Alexander Eichner, all the VirtualBox Developers, Gustau Perez and Ulf
Lilleengen. If you like to play with the current port you can checkout
the port
`here <http://svn.bluelife.at/projects/packages/blueports/emulators/virtualbox/>`__.
Please do not ping us about any problems, we know about a lot and are
still working to get them all solved before we do an official call for
testing.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Fix kernel crashes on 7.2-RELEASE.
#. Code cleanup.
#. Fix errors on AMD64.
#. Fix user/permission problems.

  http://people.freebsd.org/~linimon/studies/prs/recommended_prs.html

| Contact: Mark Linimon <bugmeister@\ >
|  Contact: Remko Lodder <bugmeister@\ >

We continue to classify PRs as they arrive, with 'tags' corresponding to
the kernel subsystem, or man page references for userland PRs. These
tags, in turn, produce lists of PRs sorted both `by
tag <http://people.freebsd.org/~linimon/studies/prs/pr_tag_index.html>`__
and `by
manpage <http://people.freebsd.org/~linimon/studies/prs/pr_manpage_index.html>`__

Mark Linimon (linimon@) has created `special reports for the Release
Engineering
Team <http://people.freebsd.org/~linimon/annotated_prs.re.html>`__ to
help focus on regressions and other areas of interest relating to the
release of FreeBSD 7.2 in the coming weeks. This is a refinement of the
`'customized reports for
developers' <http://people.freebsd.org/~linimon/annotated_prs.sample.html>`__
announced in the last status report.

A full list of all the `automatically generated
reports <http://people.freebsd.org/~linimon/studies/prs/>`__ is also
available. Any recommendations for reports which do not currently exist
but which would be beneficial are welcomed.

Mark Linimon also continues attempting to define the general problem and
investigating possible new work flow models, and will be presenting on
the subject at BSDCan.

The list of `PRs recommended for committer
evaluation <http://people.freebsd.org/~linimon/studies/prs/recommended_prs.html>`__
by the BugBusting team continues to receive new additions. This list
contains PRs, mostly with patches, that the BugBusting team feel are
probably ready to be committed as-is, or are probably trivially resolved
in the hands of a committer with knowledge of the particular subsystem.
All committers are invited to take a look at this list whenever they
have a spare 5 minutes and wish to close a PR.

Since the last status report, the number of open bugs continued to hover
around the 5600 mark, although has began to rise with the 7.2 ports
freeze.

As always, more help is appreciated, and committers and non-committers
alike are invited to join us on #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet and help
close stale PRs or commit patches from valid PRs.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs
   that the team has already analyzed.
#. Think of some way for committers to only view PRs that have been in
   some way 'vetted' or 'confirmed'.
#. Generate more publicity for what we've already got in place, and for
   what we intend to do next.
#. Define new categories, classifications, and states for PRs, that will
   better match our work flow (in progress).

--------------

FreeBSD/powerpc G5 Support
--------------------------

Contact: Nathan Whitehorn <nwhitehorn@freebsd.org\ >

FreeBSD 8.0-CURRENT now has support for PowerPC CPUs operating in the
64-bit bridge mode. This includes the PowerPC 970 (G5) as well as the
POWER3 and POWER4. Currently only Apple systems are known to work.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. IBM systems currently are not supported due to missing northbridge
   support.
#. Software fan control on SMU-based Apple G5 systems (G5 iMac, later
   Powermac G5) is not available.

--------------

FreeBSD/sparc64 UltraSPARC III support
--------------------------------------

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org\ >

Like announced in the previous status report, support for sun4u-machines
based on UltraSPARC III and beyond has been MFC'ed to stable/7 (the last
missing piece was r190297) and thus will be present in the upcoming
7.2-RELEASE and can be already tested with 7.2-RC1. Additionally, as of
r191076 machfb(4) has been fixed to work with UltraSPARC III and beyond,
that fix unfortunately did not make it into 7.2-RC1 but will be in the
final version. The X.Org 7.4 and Firefox ports as well as some other
gecko-based ones like Seamonkey once again have been fixed to also work
and package on sparc64, including on UltraSPARC III and UltraSPARC IIIi
based machines equipped with cards driven by creator(4) or machfb(4).
The driver for the Sun Cassini/Cassini+ as well as National
Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit NICs found on-board for example in
Fire V440 and as add-on cards is coming along nicely, the last thing
which needs to be implemented before it can hit CURRENT is support for
jumbo frames.

The FreeBSD Dutch Documentation Project is an ongoing project to
translate FreeBSD Documentation into the Dutch language.

The translation of the Handbook was completed last January. It is kept
up-to-date with the English version. Furthermore five articles and the
flyer have been translated.

Some initial work has been done to translate the website, but most
likely more translators are needed to fully realize it.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Recruit more translators.
#. Keep the translations up-to-date with the English versions.
#. Finish the translation of the FAQ.
#. Translate more articles and maybe some books.

| Contact: Johann Kois <jkois@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Martin Wilke <miwi@FreeBSD.org\ >

In February 2009 the German version of the FreeBSD Developer's handbook
went online. Additionally we managed to update large areas of the FAQ
thanks to the contributions of Benedict Reuschling.

The website (at least the areas we see as relevant for a translation) is
translated and updated constantly.

More volunteers are always welcome of course, as there is still plenty
of work to be done.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Update the existing documentation set (especially the handbook).
#. Read the translations. Check for problems/mistakes. Send feedback.

Currently, grep is finished and is only waiting for a portbuild test. It
is known to be more or less feature complete, while it is much smaller
than the GNU version.

As for sort, there has been some progress with the complete rewrite and
it is lacking few options. Performance is to be measured, as well.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test grep on pointyhat.
#. Complete sort with the missing features.
#. Do performance measurements for sort and look for possible
   optimization opportunities.
#. Test sort on pointyhat.
