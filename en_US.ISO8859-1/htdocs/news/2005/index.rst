|FreeBSD News|
December 2005
=============

-  \ **23 December, 2005:** The FreeBSD Foundation has published its
   `December
   Newsletter <http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/press/2005Dec-newsletter.shtml>`__,
   which summarizes the activities the Foundation has undertaken this
   year.

-  \ **21 December, 2005:** Returned committer: `Jason
   Evans <mailto:jasone@FreeBSD.org>`__ (src)

-  \ **17 December, 2005:** The release engineering team, represented by
   Scott Long, has announced the release schedule for 2006. Please refer
   to the
   `announcement <http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2005-December/058964.html>`__
   for more information.

-  \ **14 December, 2005:** Read-only support for the XFS file system
   has been committed to FreeBSD-CURRENT. The code is derived from
   sources provided by SGI and is covered by the GPL. Additional
   information can be found in the
   `announcement <http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2005-December/058907.html>`__.

-  \ **12 December, 2005:** New committer: `Andrey
   Slusar <mailto:anray@FreeBSD.org>`__ (ports)

-  \ **7 December, 2005:** The FreeBSD project has hundreds of active
   developers spread all over the world, and many of them have their own
   parts of the source-tree that they work on. However, there are always
   a lot of new interesting projects and ideas that needs to be
   investigated and evaluated, and this is where the FreeBSD project
   relies on heroic efforts from volunteers. A new section on the
   FreeBSD website has been created with the purpose of listing such
   projects. The list is in no way complete, but it should serve as a
   nice starting point for volunteers who would like to become
   committers in the future. You can `view the projects list
   here <../../projects/ideas/>`__.

-  \ **1 December, 2005:** The FreeBSD Foundation received a donation of
   a blade system from Hewlett-Packard for use as a third-party software
   build cluster. This 20-node HP BladeSystem cluster triples the speed
   of the build process for i386 packages. You can `see more details
   from
   here <http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/press/20051201-PRreleaseHP.pdf>`__.

-  \ **1 December, 2005:** New committer: `Tim
   Bishop <mailto:tdb@FreeBSD.org>`__ (ports)

November 2005
=============

-  \ **29 November, 2005:** New committer: `Oleg
   Bulyzhin <mailto:oleg@FreeBSD.org>`__ (src)

-  \ **27 November, 2005:** A new article, `Building Products with
   FreeBSD <../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/building-products/>`__
   describes the benefits of collaborating with the FreeBSD project when
   developing products. Much of the engineering cost of software product
   development for a successful product comes from the need to evolve to
   keep pace with the market. By working with a mature, reuse-friendly
   source base like that of the FreeBSD project, and by following the
   best-practices listed in this article, organizations can reap the
   benefits of reduced engineering costs and improved market
   adaptability.

-  \ **18 November, 2005:** The July-October, 2005 status report is `now
   available <../../news/status/report-july-2005-oct-2005.html>`__ with
   37 entries.

-  \ **5 November, 2005:** KDE 3.4.3 has been merged into the ports
   tree. For a detailed list of improvements since the KDE 3.4.2
   release, please refer to the KDE 3.4.2
   `changelog <http://www.kde.org/announcements/changelogs/changelog3_4_2to3_4_3.php>`__.
   For more information, see the KDE 3.4.3 `info
   page <http://www.kde.org/info/3.4.3.php>`__. For general information
   about KDE on FreeBSD, please see the KDE on FreeBSD `project
   page <http://freebsd.kde.org>`__.

-  \ **5 November, 2005:** Now that 6.0 is out the door, GNOME 2.12.1
   has been merged into the ports tree. Be sure to checkout our `upgrade
   FAQ <../../gnome/docs/faq212.html>`__ for all the changes, upgrade
   instructions, and known issues. Additional resources can be found at
   the `FreeBSD GNOME homepage <../../gnome/index.html>`__.

-  \ **4 November, 2005:** `FreeBSD
   6.0-RELEASE <../../releases/6.0R/announce.html>`__ has been released.
   Please check the `release errata <../../releases/6.0R/errata.html>`__
   before installation for any late-breaking news and/or issues with
   6.0. The `Release Information <../../releases/index.html>`__ page has
   more information about FreeBSD releases.

-  \ **1 November, 2005:** We are pleased to announce the winner of our
   logo competition: Anton K. Gural. For competition details, please see
   the `result page <http://logo-contest.freebsd.org/result/>`__. With
   our new logo, we will be able to show our own identity on the 'net,
   and this will make our marketing efforts much easier. We will publish
   soon a guideline page which gives usage rules and usable (vector
   format) logo data under the same BSD license as the rest of FreeBSD.

   the user who is considering installing FreeBSD, and also existing
   users who wish to plan their future upgrades.

-  \ **5 August, 2005:** `6.0-BETA2

   Open Source Alternative to
   Linux <../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/linux-comparison/>`__. The

   benefits provided by FreeBSD, and where applicable, compare those
   features to Linux. This paper provides a starting point for those
   interested in exploring Open Source alternatives to Linux.

-  | \ **16 July, 2005:** The FreeBSD Project received over 350
     applications for `Google's Summer of
     Code <http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html>`__ program, amongst
     which 18 were selected for funding. Unfortunately, there were far
     more first rate applications than available spots for students.
     However, we encourage students to work together with us all year
     round. The FreeBSD Project is always willing to help mentor
     students learn more about operating system development through our
     normal community mailing lists and development forums. Contributing
     to an open source software project is a valuable component of a
     computer science education and great preparation for a career in
     software development.
   | More information about the funded student projects is available
     from the `FreeBSD Summer of Code
     Wiki <http://wiki.freebsd.org/moin.cgi/SummerOfCode2005>`__.
