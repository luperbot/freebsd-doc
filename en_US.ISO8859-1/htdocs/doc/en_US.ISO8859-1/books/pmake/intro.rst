PMake is a program for creating other programs, or anything else you can
think of for it to do. The basic idea behind PMake is that, for any
given system, be it a program or a document or whatever, there will be
some files that depend on the state of other files (on when they were
last modified). PMake takes these dependencies, which you must specify,
and uses them to build whatever it is you want it to build.

PMake is almost fully-compatible with Make, with which you may already
be familiar. PMake's most important feature is its ability to run
several different jobs at once, making the creation of systems
considerably faster. It also has a great deal more functionality than
Make.

This tutorial is divided into three main sections corresponding to
basic, intermediate and advanced PMake usage. If you already know Make
well, you will only need to skim `Chapter?2, *The Basics of
PMake* <basics.html>`__ (there are some aspects of PMake that I consider
basic to its use that did not exist in Make). Things in `Chapter?3,
*Short-cuts and Other Nice Things* <shortcuts.html>`__ make life much
easier, while those in `Chapter?4, *PMake for Gods* <gods.html>`__ are
strictly for those who know what they are doing. `Glossary of
Jargon <glossary.html>`__ has definitions for the jargon I use and
`Chapter?5, *Answers to Exercises* <answers.html>`__ contains possible
solutions to the problems presented throughout the tutorial.
