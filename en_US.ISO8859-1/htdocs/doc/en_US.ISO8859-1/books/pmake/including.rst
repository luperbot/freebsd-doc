3.2.?Including Other Makefiles

Just as for programs, it is often useful to extract certain parts of a
makefile into another file and just include it in other makefiles
somehow. Many compilers allow you say something like:

.. code:: programlisting

    #include "defs.h"

to include the contents of ``defs.h`` in the source file. PMake allows
you to do the same thing for makefiles, with the added ability to use
variables in the filenames. An include directive in a makefile looks
either like this:

.. code:: programlisting

    #include <file>

or this:

.. code:: programlisting

    #include "file"

The difference between the two is where PMake searches for the file: the
first way, PMake will look for the file only in the system makefile
directory (or directories) (to find out what that directory is, give
PMake the ``-h`` flag). The system makefile directory search path can be
overridden via the ``-m`` option. For files in double-quotes, the search
is more complex:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="orderedlist">

#. The directory of the makefile that's including the file.

#. The current directory (the one in which you invoked PMake).

#. The directories given by you using ``-I`` flags, in the order in
   which you gave them.

#. Directories given by ``.PATH`` dependency lines (see `Chapter?4,
   *PMake for Gods* <gods.html>`__).

#. The system makefile directory.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

in that order.

You are free to use PMake variables in the filename â€“ PMake will expand
them before searching for the file. You must specify the searching
method with either angle brackets or double-quotes outside of a variable
expansion. I.e. the following:

.. code:: programlisting

    SYSTEM    = <command.mk>

    #include $(SYSTEM)

will not work.
