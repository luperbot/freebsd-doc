3.?Why is BSD not better known?

For a number of reasons, BSD is relatively unknown:

#. The BSD developers are often more interested in polishing their code
   than marketing it.

#. Much of Linux's popularity is due to factors external to the Linux
   projects, such as the press, and to companies formed to provide Linux
   services. Until recently, the open source BSDs had no such
   proponents.

#. BSD developers tend to be more experienced than Linux developers, and
   have less interest in making the system easy to use. Newcomers tend
   to feel more comfortable with Linux.

#. In 1992, AT&T sued `BSDI <http://www.bsdi.com/>`__, the vendor of
   BSD/386, alleging that the product contained AT&T-copyrighted code.
   The case was settled out of court in 1994, but the spectre of the
   litigation continues to haunt people. As recently as March 2000 an
   article published on the web claimed that the court case had been
   “recently settled”.

   One detail that the lawsuit did clarify is the naming: in the 1980s,
   BSD was known as “BSD UNIX?”. With the elimination of the last
   vestige of AT&T code from BSD, it also lost the right to the name
   UNIX?. Thus you will see references in book titles to “the 4.3BSD
   UNIX? operating system” and “the 4.4BSD operating system”.

#. There is a perception that the BSD projects are fragmented and
   belligerent. The `Wall Street
   Journal <http://interactive.wsj.com/bin/login?Tag=/&URI=/archive/retrieve.cgi%253Fid%253DSB952470579348918651.djm&>`__
   spoke of “balkanization” of the BSD projects. Like the law suit, this
   perception bases mainly on ancient history.
