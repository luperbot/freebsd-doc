Often you will want to send in additional information to a question you
have already sent. The best way to do this is to reply to your original
message. This has three advantages:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="orderedlist">

#. You include the original message text, so people will know what you
   are talking about. Do not forget to trim unnecessary text out,
   though.

#. The text in the subject line stays the same (you did remember to put
   one in, did you not?). Many mailers will sort messages by subject.
   This helps group messages together.

#. The message reference numbers in the header will refer to the
   previous message. Some mailers, such as
   `mutt <http://www.mutt.org/>`__, can *thread* messages, showing the
   exact relationships between the messages.
