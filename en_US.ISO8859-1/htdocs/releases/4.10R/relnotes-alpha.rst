2.1 Security Advisories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A potential denial of service in **BIND** has been fixed. For more
information, see security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-03:19 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:19.bind.asc>`__.

A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface (specifically the
`shmat(2) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=shmat&sektion=2&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
system call) has been fixed. This bug can cause a shared memory segment
to reference unallocated kernel memory. In turn, this can permit a local
attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory, possibly
resulting in disclosure of sensitive information, bypass of access
control mechanisms, or privilege escalation. More details can be found
in security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-04:02 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc>`__.

A potential low-bandwidth denial-of-service attack against the FreeBSD
TCP stack has been prevented by limiting the number of out-of-sequence
TCP segments that can be held at one time. More details can be found in
security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-04:04 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc>`__.

A bug in **OpenSSL**'s SSL/TLS ChangeCipherSpec message processing could
result in a null pointer dereference, has been fixed. This could allow a
remote attacker to crash an **OpenSSL**-using application and cause a
denial-of-service on the system. More details can be found in security
advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-04:05 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:05.openssl.asc>`__.

Two programming errors in **CVS** have been fixed. They allow a server
to overwrite arbitrary files on the client, and a client to read
arbitrary files on the server when accessing remote CVS repositories.
More details can be found in security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-04:07 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:07.cvs.asc>`__.

A bugfix for **Heimdal** rectifies a problem in which it would not
perform adequate checking of authentication across autonomous realms.
For more information, see security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-04:08 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:08.heimdal.asc>`__.

A fix in
`kadmind(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kadmind&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
closes a potential buffer overflow. Details can be found in security
advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-04:09 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:09.kadmind.asc>`__.

\`\`dumb console'' driver has been added to provide a local and remote
console. It can be accessed over FireWire using the
`dcons\_crom(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dcons_crom&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
driver. A
`dconschat(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dconschat&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
utility provides user access to
`dcons(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dcons&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
devices.

A bug in
`mmap(2) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mmap&sektion=2&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
that pages marked as PROT\_NONE may become readable under certain
circumstances, has been fixed.

images.

`ifconfig(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
now supports a staticarp option for an interface, which disables the
sending of ARP requests for that interface.

`ifconfig(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
now prints the
`polling(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=polling&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
status on the interface.

`killall(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=killall&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
now supports a -e flag to make the -u operate on effective, rather than
real, user IDs.

The default mode for the ``lost+found`` directory of
`fsck(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
is now 0700 instead of 01777.

The ``libalias`` library,
`natd(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=natd&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__,
and
`ppp(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ppp&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
now support Cisco Skinny Station protocol, which is the protocol used by
Cisco IP phones to talk to Cisco Call Managers. Note that currently
having the Call Manager behind the NAT gateway is not supported.

`makewhatis(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=makewhatis&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__,
formerly a Perl script, has been reimplemented in C.

`ps(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ps&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
compatibility with POSIX/SUSv3 has been improved. The changes include -p
for a list of process IDs, -t for a list of terminal names, -A which is
equivalent to -ax, -G for a list of group IDs, -X which is the opposite
of -x, and some minor improvements. For more information, see
`ps(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ps&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__.

`pw(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pw&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
now supports a -H option, which accepts an encrypted password on a file
descriptor.

`rtld(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rtld&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
now has support for the dynamic mapping of shared object dependencies.
More information on using this feature can be found in
`libmap.conf(5) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=libmap.conf&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__.

`stat(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=stat&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
from **NetBSD**, as of 5 June 2002 has, been imported.

`which(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=which&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__,
formerly a Perl script, has been reimplemented in C.

2.5 Ports/Packages Collection Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SIZE attribute for distfiles, which can be used for checking file
sizes before fetching, has been added and enabled by default.
DISABLE\_SIZE is a user control knob to disable the distfile size
checking. This is especially useful on old FreeBSD versions which didn't
have
`fetch(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fetch&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__
support for this, and for some FTP proxies which always report incorrect
or bogus sizes.

Two new files have been added to the ports tree to track note-worthy
changes: ``ports/CHANGES`` lists major changes to the Ports Collection
and its infrastructure. ``ports/UPDATING`` describes some potential
pitfalls that can be encountered when updating certain ports, analogous
to ``src/UPDATING`` for the base system.

2.6 Release Engineering and Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The supported release of **GNOME** has been updated from 2.4 to 2.6.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="NOTE">

    **Note:** If you are using the older **GNOME** desktop itself
    (```x11/gnome2`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/x11/gnome2/pkg-descr>`__),
    simply upgrading it from the FreeBSD Ports Collection with
    `portupgrade(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=portupgrade&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+Ports>`__
    (```sysutils/portupgrade`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/sysutils/portupgrade/pkg-descr>`__)
    will cause serious problems. If you are a **GNOME** desktop user,
    please read the instructions carefully at
    http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/faq26.html, and use the
    ``gnome_upgrade.sh`` script to properly upgrade to **GNOME** 2.6.

    Note that if you are just a casual user of some of the **GNOME**
    libraries,
    `portupgrade(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=portupgrade&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+Ports>`__
    should be sufficient to update your ports.

3 Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
---------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, you generally
will have three options:

-  Using the binary upgrade option of
   `sysinstall(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysinstall&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-RELEASE>`__.
   This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes that your
   installation of FreeBSD uses no special compilation options.

-  Performing a complete reinstall of FreeBSD. Technically, this is not
   an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less convenient than
   a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to manually backup and
   restore the contents of ``/etc``. However, it may be useful in cases
   where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of your disks.

-  From source code in ``/usr/src``. This route is more flexible, but
   requires more disk space, time, and technical expertise. More
   information can be found in the `\`\`Using
   ``make world``'' <http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html>`__
   section of the `FreeBSD
   Handbook <http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/>`__.
   Upgrading from very old versions of FreeBSD may be problematic; in
   cases like this, it is usually more effective to perform a binary
   upgrade or a complete reinstall.

Please read the ``INSTALL.TXT`` file for more information, preferably
*before* beginning an upgrade. If you are upgrading from source, please
be sure to read ``/usr/src/UPDATING`` as well.

Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the -STABLE or
-CURRENT branches of FreeBSD, please be sure to consult the
`\`\`-CURRENT vs.
-STABLE'' <http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html>`__
section of the `FreeBSD
Handbook <http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/>`__.

   <div class="IMPORTANT">

    **Important:** Upgrading FreeBSD should, of course, only be
    attempted after backing up *all* data and configuration files.
