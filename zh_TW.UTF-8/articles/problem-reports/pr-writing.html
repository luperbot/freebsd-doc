Writing the problem report</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you have decided that your issue merits a problem
      report, and that it is a FreeBSD problem, it is time to write
      the actual problem report.  Before we get into the mechanics
      of the program used to generate and submit PRs, here are some
      tips and tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp63506128"></a>4.1. Tips and tricks for writing a good problem report</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not leave the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span>
	    line empty.</em></span>  The PRs go both onto a mailing list
	    that goes all over the world (where the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span>
	    is used
	    for the <code class="literal">Subject:</code> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the
	    noise.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Avoid using a weak <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span>
	    line.</em></span>  You should not assume that anyone reading
	    your PR has any context for your submission, so the more
	    you provide, the better.  For instance, what part of the
	    system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see the
	    problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of <code class="literal">Synopsis: portupgrade is
	    broken</code>, see how much more informative this
	    seems: <code class="literal">Synopsis: port sysutils/portupgrade
	    coredumps on -current</code>.  (In the case of ports,
	    it is especially helpful to have both the category and
	    portname in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span> line.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you have a patch, say so.</em></span>
	    A PR with a patch included is much more likely to be
	    looked at than one without.  If you are including one,
	    put the string <code class="literal">[patch]</code> at the
	    beginning of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span>.  (Although it is
	    not mandatory to use that exact string, by convention,
	    that is the one that is used.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you are a maintainer, say so.</em></span>
	    If you are maintaining a part of the source code (for
	    instance, a port), you might consider adding the string
	    <code class="literal">[maintainer update]</code> at the beginning of
	    your synopsis line, and you definitely should set the
	    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Class</span>”</span> of
	    your PR to <code class="literal">maintainer-update</code>.  This way
	    any committer that handles your PR will not have to check.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be specific.</em></span>

	    PRs of the form <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">someone should really implement something
	    that does so-and-so</span>”</span> are less likely to get results than
	    very specific requests.  Remember, the source is available
	    to everyone, so if you want a feature, the best way to
	    ensure it being included is to get to work!  Also consider
	    the fact that many things like this would make a better
	    topic for discussion on <code class="literal">freebsd-questions</code>
	    than an entry in the PR database, as discussed above.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Make sure no one else has already submitted

	    mentioned above, it bears repeating here.  It only take a

	<code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mail.html" target="_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mail.html</a></code>.</p><p>Make sure that your mailer will not mangle the message on
	its way to GNATS.  In particular, if your mailer automatically
	breaks lines, changes tabs to spaces, or escapes newline
	characters, any patch that you submit will be rendered
	unusable.  For the text sections, however, we request that
	you insert manual linebreaks somewhere around 70 characters,
	so that the web display of the PR will be readable.</p><p>Similar considerations apply if you are using the web-based
	PR submittal form instead of <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>.  Note that

Attaching patches or files</h3></div></div></div><p>The following applies to submitting PRs via email:</p><p>The <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a> program has provisions for attaching
	files to a problem report.  You can attach as many files as
	you want provided that each has a unique base name (i.e. the
	name of the file proper, without the path).  Just use the
	<code class="option">-a</code> command-line option to specify the names
	of the files you wish to attach:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>send-pr -a /var/run/dmesg -a /tmp/errors</code></strong></pre><p>Do not worry about binary files, they will be automatically
	encoded so as not to upset your mail agent.</p><p>If you attach a patch, make sure you use the
	<code class="option">-c</code> or <code class="option">-u</code> option to
	<a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span></a> to create a context or unified diff (unified is
	preferred), and make
	sure to specify the exact CVS revision numbers of the files
	you modified so the developers who read your report will be
	able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or the
	base utilities, a patch against FreeBSD-CURRENT (the HEAD
	CVS branch) is preferred since all new code should be applied
	and tested there first.  After appropriate or substantial testing
	has been done, the code will be merged/migrated to the FreeBSD-STABLE
	branch.</p><p>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of some
	email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will completely
	ruin anything intended to be part of a Makefile.</p><p>Do not send patches as attachments using
	<code class="command">Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</code>.
	These will perform character escaping and the entire patch
	will be useless.</p><p>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right——particularly when they fix the problem
	described in the PR——large patches and especially new code
	which may require substantial review before committing should
	be placed on a web or ftp server, and the URL should be
	included in the PR instead of the patch.  Patches in email
	tend to get mangled, especially when GNATS is involved, and
	the larger the patch, the harder it will be for interested
	parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on the web
	allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the entire
	patch in a followup to the original PR.  Finally, large
	patches simply increase the size of the database, since
	closed PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and
	simply marked as <code class="literal">closed</code>.</p><p>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp63688784"></a>4.4.

	template.  The template consists of a list of fields, some of
	which are pre-filled, and some of which have comments explaining
	their purpose or listing acceptable values.  Do not worry
	about the comments; they will be removed automatically if you
	do not modify them or remove them yourself.</p><p>At the top of the template, below the
	<code class="literal">SEND-PR:</code> lines, are the email headers.  You
	do not normally need to modify these, unless you are sending
	the problem report from a machine or account that can send but
	not receive mail, in which case you will want to set the
	<code class="literal">From:</code> and <code class="literal">Reply-To:</code> to
	your real email address.  You may also want to send yourself
	(or someone else) a carbon copy of the problem report by
	adding one or more email addresses to the
	<code class="literal">Cc:</code> header.</p><p>In the email template you will find the following two
	single-line fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Submitter-Id:</em></span> Do not change this.
