When to submit a problem report</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should
      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when you are convinced you have found a bug
      in a program when in fact you have misunderstood the syntax for
      a command or made a typographical error in a configuration file
      (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the right
      course of action, and will only serve to frustrate you and the
      developers.  Conversely, there are cases where it might be
      appropriate to submit a problem report about something else than
      a bug——an enhancement or a feature request, for
      instance.</p><p>So how do you determine what is a bug and what is not?  As a
      simple rule of thumb your problem is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a
      bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">How do I do X?</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Where can I find
      Y?</span>”</span>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  If you are looking
      for an answer, consider posing your question to the
      <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD general questions 郵遞論壇</a>.</p><p>Some cases where it may be appropriate to submit a problem
      report about something that is not a bug are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Requests for feature enhancements.  It is generally a
	  good idea to air these on the mailing lists before
	  submitting a problem report.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Notification of updates to externally maintained
	  software (mainly ports, but also externally maintained base
	  system components such as BIND or various GNU
	  utilities).</p><p>For unmaintained ports (<code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code> contains
	  <code class="literal">ports@FreeBSD.org</code>), such update notifications
	  might get picked up by an interested
	  committer, or you might be asked to provide a patch to update
	  the port; providing it upfront will greatly improve your chances
	  that the port will get updated in a timely manner.</p><p>If the port is maintained, PRs announcing new upstream releases
	  are usually not very useful since they generate supplementary work
	  for the committers, and the maintainer likely knows already there is
	  a new version, they have probably worked with the developers on it,
	  they are probably testing to see there is no regression, etc.</p><p>In either case, following the process described in <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/zh_TW.UTF-8/books/porters-handbook/port-upgrading.html" target="_top">Porter's
	  Handbook</a> will yield the best results.</p></li></ul></div><p>A bug that can not be reproduced can rarely be
      fixed.  If the bug only occurred once and you can not reproduce
      it, and it does not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are
      none of the developers will be able to reproduce it or figure
      out what is wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it
      does mean that the chances of your problem report ever leading
      to a bug fix are very slim.  To make matters worse, often
      these kinds of bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives
      or overheating processors —— you should always try to rule
      out these causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</p><p>Next, to decide to whom you should file your problem
      report, you need to understand that the software that makes
      up FreeBSD is composed of several different elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by FreeBSD contributors, such as the kernel, the C library,
	  and the device drivers (categorized as <code class="literal">kern</code>);
	  the binary utilities (<code class="literal">bin</code>); the manual
	  pages and documentation (<code class="literal">docs</code>); and
	  the web pages (<code class="literal">www</code>).  All bugs in
	  these areas should be reported to the FreeBSD developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by others, and imported into FreeBSD and adapted.  Examples
	  include <span class="application">bind</span>, <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gcc&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">gcc</span>(1)</span></a>, and
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sendmail</span>(8)</span></a>.  Most bugs in these areas should be reported
	  to the FreeBSD developers; but in some cases they may need to be
	  reported to the original authors instead if the problems are
	  not FreeBSD-specific.  Usually these bugs will fall under either
	  the <code class="literal">bin</code> or <code class="literal">gnu</code>
	  categories.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Individual applications that are not in the base system
	  but are instead part of the FreeBSD Ports Collection (category
	  <code class="literal">ports</code>).  Most of these applications are
	  not written by FreeBSD developers; what FreeBSD provides is merely
	  a framework for installing the application.  Therefore, you
	  should only report a problem to the FreeBSD developers when you
	  believe the problem is FreeBSD-specific; otherwise, you should
	  report it to the authors of the software.</p></li></ul></div><p>Then you should ascertain whether or not the problem is
      timely.  There are few things
      that will annoy a developer more than receiving a problem report
      about a bug she has already fixed.</p><p>If the problem is in the base system, you should first read
      the FAQ section on
      <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/zh_TW.UTF-8/books/faq/introduction.html#LATEST-VERSION" target="_top">
      FreeBSD versions</a>, if you are not already familiar with
      the topic.  It is not possible for FreeBSD to fix problems in
      anything other than certain recent branches of the base system,
      so filing a bug report about an older version will probably
      only result in a developer advising you to upgrade to a
      supported version to see if the problem still recurs.  The
      Security Officer team maintains the
      <a class="link" href="http://www.freebsd.org/security/" target="_top">list of supported
      versions</a>.</p><p>If the problem is in a port, note that you must first
      upgrade to the latest version of the Ports Collection and see
      if the problem still applies.  Due to the rapid pace of changes
      in these applications, it is infeasible for FreeBSD to support
      anything other than the absolute latest versions, and problems
      with older version of applications simply cannot be fixed.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">前一頁</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="pr-prep.html">下一頁</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Writing FreeBSD Problem Reports </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">起始頁</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3.
