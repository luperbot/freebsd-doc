      the FreeBSD project to help people who have questions about the normal
      use of FreeBSD.  Another group, <code class="literal">FreeBSD-hackers</code>,
      discusses more advanced questions such as future development
      work.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">注意: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hacker</span>”</span> has nothing to do with breaking
	into other people's computers.  The correct term for the latter
	activity is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cracker</span>”</span>, but the popular press has not found
	out yet.  The FreeBSD hackers disapprove strongly of cracking
	security, and have nothing to do with it.  For a longer description of
	hackers, see Eric Raymond's <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_top">How To Become
	A Hacker</a></p></div><p>This is a regular posting aimed to help both those seeking advice

      who answer the questions (the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hackers</span>”</span>).</p><p>Inevitably there is some friction, which stems from the different
      viewpoints of the two groups.  The newcomers accuse the hackers of being
      arrogant, stuck-up, and unhelpful, while the hackers accuse the
      newcomers of being stupid, unable to read plain English, and expecting
      everything to be handed to them on a silver platter.  Of course, there is
      an element of truth in both these claims, but for the most part these
      viewpoints come from a sense of frustration.</p><p>In this document, I would like to do something to relieve this
      frustration and help everybody get better results from
      FreeBSD-questions.  In the following section, I recommend how to submit
      a question; after that, we will look at how to answer one.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp61571152"></a>2.

How to unsubscribe from FreeBSD-questions</h2></div></div></div><p>When you subscribed to FreeBSD-questions, you got a welcome message
      from <span class="application">mailman</span>.  In this message, amongst
      other things, it told you how to unsubscribe.  Here is a typical
      message:</p><pre class="literallayout">Welcome to the freebsd-questions@freebsd.org mailing list!

To post to this list, send your email to:

  freebsd-questions@freebsd.org

General information about the mailing list is at:

  http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions

If you ever want to unsubscribe or change your options (e.g., switch to
or from digest mode, change your password, etc.), visit your
subscription page at:

http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/options/freebsd-questions/grog%40lemsi.de

You can also make such adjustments via email by sending a message to:

  freebsd-questions-request@freebsd.org

with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.

You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  It is:

  12345

Normally, Mailman will remind you of your freebsd.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.</pre><p>From the URL specified in your <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Welcome</span>”</span> message you
      may visit the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Account management page</span>”</span> and enter a request

      <code class="literal">FreeBSD-questions</code> and
      <code class="literal">FreeBSD-hackers</code>.  In some cases, it is not really

      for 99% of all questions, however:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>If the question is of a general nature, ask
	  <code class="literal">FreeBSD-questions</code>.  Examples might be questions

	  utility.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you think the question relates to a bug, but you are not sure,
	  or you do not know how to look for it, send the message to
	  <code class="literal">FreeBSD-questions</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the question relates to a bug, and you are
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> that it is a bug (for example, you can

	  a fix), then send the message to
	  <code class="literal">FreeBSD-hackers</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the question relates to enhancements to FreeBSD, and you
	  can make suggestions about how to implement them, then send the
	  message to <code class="literal">FreeBSD-hackers</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>There are also a number of other specialized mailing lists, for
      example <code class="literal">FreeBSD-isp</code>, which caters to the interests of
      ISPs (Internet Service Providers) who run FreeBSD.  If you happen to be
      an ISP, this does not mean you should automatically send your questions
      to <code class="literal">FreeBSD-isp</code>.  The criteria above still apply, and
      it is in your interest to stick to them, since you are more likely to get
      good results that way.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp61644496"></a>5.

      on one of the mailing lists:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Try solving the problem on your own.  If you post a question which
	  shows that you have tried to solve the problem, your question will
	  generally attract more positive attention from people reading it.
	  Trying to solve the problem yourself will also enhance your understanding
	  of FreeBSD, and will eventually let you use your knowledge to help others
	  by answering questions posted to the mailing lists.

How to submit a question</h2></div></div></div><p>When submitting a question to FreeBSD-questions, consider the
      following points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Remember that nobody gets paid for answering a FreeBSD
	  question. They do it of their own free will.  You can influence this
	  free will positively by submitting a well-formulated question
	  supplying as much relevant information as possible.  You can
	  influence this free will negatively by submitting an incomplete,
	  illegible, or rude question. It is perfectly possible to send a
	  message to FreeBSD-questions and not get an answer even if you
	  follow these rules.  It is much more possible to not get an answer if
	  you do not.  In the rest of this document, we will look at how to get
	  the most out of your question to FreeBSD-questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Not everybody who answers FreeBSD questions reads every message:
	  they look at the subject line and decide whether it interests them.
	  Clearly, it is in your interest to specify a subject. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">FreeBSD
	  problem</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Help</span>”</span> are not enough.  If you provide no subject at
	  all, many people will not bother reading it.  If your subject is not
	  specific enough, the people who can answer it may not read
	  it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Format your message so that it is	legible, and
	    PLEASE DO NOT SHOUT!!!!!.  We appreciate that a lot of people do not
	    speak English as their first language, and we try to make
	    allowances for that, but it is really painful to try to read a
	    message written full of typos or without any line breaks.</p><p>Do not underestimate the effect that a poorly formatted mail
	  message has, not just on the FreeBSD-questions mailing list.
	  Your mail message is all people see of you, and if it is poorly
	  formatted, one line per paragraph, badly spelt, or full of
	  errors, it will give people a poor impression of you.</p><p>A lot of badly formatted messages come from
	  <a class="link" href="http://www.lemis.com/email.html" target="_top">bad mailers or badly
	  configured mailers</a>.  The following mailers are known to
	  send out badly formatted messages without you finding out about
	  them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>cc:Mail</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Eudora</span>®</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>exmh</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® Exchange</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® Internet Mail</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>® <span class="trademark">Outlook</span>®</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="trademark">Netscape</span>®</p></li></ul></div><p>As you can see, the mailers in the Microsoft world are frequent
	  offenders.  If at all possible, use a <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>® mailer. If you must use a
	  mailer under Microsoft environments, make sure it is set up
	  correctly. Try not to use <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>: a lot of people
	  use mailers which do not get on very well with
	  <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure your time and time zone are set correctly.  This may
	  seem a little silly, since your message still gets there, but many
	  of the people you are trying to reach get several hundred messages a
	  day.  They frequently sort the incoming messages by subject and by
	  date, and if your message does not come before the first answer, they
	  may assume they missed it and not bother to look.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do not include unrelated questions in the same message.  Firstly,
	  a long message tends to scare people off, and secondly, it is more
	  difficult to get all the people who can answer all the questions to
	  read the message.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Specify as much information as possible. This is a difficult
	  area, and we need to expand on what information you need to submit,
	  but here is a start:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>In nearly every case, it is important to know the version of
	      FreeBSD you are running.  This is particularly the case for
	      FreeBSD-CURRENT, where you should also specify the date of the
	      sources, though of course you should not be sending questions
	      about -CURRENT to FreeBSD-questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>With any problem which <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be
	      hardware related, tell us about your hardware.  In case of
	      doubt, assume it is possible that it is hardware.  What kind of
	      CPU are you using?  How fast?  What motherboard?  How much
	      memory?  What peripherals?</p><p>There is a judgement call here, of course, but the output of
	      the <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a> command can frequently be very useful, since it
	      tells not just what hardware you are running, but what version of
	      FreeBSD as well.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you get error messages, do not say <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I get error
		messages</span>”</span>, say (for example) <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I get the error
		message 'No route to host'</span>”</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If your system panics, do not say <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">My system
		panicked</span>”</span>, say (for example) <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">my system panicked
		with the message 'free vnode isn't'</span>”</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have difficulty installing FreeBSD, please tell us
	      what hardware you have.  In particular, it is important to know
	      the IRQs and I/O addresses of the boards installed in your
	      machine.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have difficulty getting PPP to run, describe the
	      configuration.  Which version of PPP do you use?  What kind of
	      authentication do you have?  Do you have a static or dynamic IP
	      address?  What kind of messages do you get in the log
	      file?</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the information you need to supply is the output of
	  programs, such as <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a>, or console messages, which usually
	  appear in <code class="filename">/var/log/messages</code>.  Do not try to copy
	  this information by typing it in again; it is a real pain, and you are
	  bound to make a mistake. To send log file contents, either make a
	  copy of the file and use an editor to trim the information to what
	  is relevant, or cut and paste into your message.  For the output of
	  programs like <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dmesg</span>(8)</span></a>, redirect the output to a file and
	  include that.  For example,</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>dmesg &gt; /tmp/dmesg.out</code></strong></pre><p>This redirects the information to the file
	  <code class="filename">/tmp/dmesg.out</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you do all this, and you still do not get an answer, there
	  could be other reasons.  For example, the problem is so complicated
	  that nobody knows the answer, or the person who does know the answer
	  was offline.  If you do not get an answer after, say, a week, it
	  might help to re-send the message.  If you do not get an answer to
	  your second message, though, you are probably not going to get one
	  from this forum.  Resending the same message again and again will
	  only make you unpopular.</p></li></ul></div><p>To summarize, let's assume you know the answer to the following
      question (yes, it is the same one in each case).
      You choose which of these two questions you would be more prepared to

How to answer a question</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you answer a question to FreeBSD-questions, consider:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the points on submitting questions also apply to
	  answering questions.  Read them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Has somebody already answered the question?  The easiest way to
	  check this is to sort your incoming mail by subject: then
	  (hopefully) you will see the question followed by any answers, all
	  together.</p><p>If somebody has already answered it, it does not automatically
	  mean that you should not send another answer.  But it makes sense to
	  read all the other answers first.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do you have something to contribute beyond what has already been
	  said?  In general, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Yeah, me too</span>”</span> answers do not help
	  much, although there are exceptions, like when somebody is
	  describing a problem he is having, and he does not know whether it is
	  his fault or whether there is something wrong with the hardware or
	  software.  If you do send a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">me too</span>”</span> answer, you should
	  also include any further relevant information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure you understand the question?  Very frequently, the
	  person who asks the question is confused or does not express himself
	  very well.  Even with the best understanding of the system, it is
	  easy to send a reply which does not answer the question.  This
	  does not help: you will leave the person who submitted the question
	  more frustrated or confused than ever.  If nobody else answers, and
	  you are not too sure either, you can always ask for more
	  information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure your answer is correct?
	If not, wait a day or so. If nobody else comes up with a
	better answer, you can still reply and say, for example, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I
	do not know if this is correct, but since nobody else has
	replied, why don't you try replacing your ATAPI CDROM with
	a frog?</span>”</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, reply to the
	  sender and to FreeBSD-questions. Many people on the
	  FreeBSD-questions are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">lurkers</span>”</span>: they learn by reading
	  messages sent and replied to by others. If you take a message which
	  is of general interest off the list, you are depriving these people
	  of their information. Be careful with group replies; lots of people
	  send messages with hundreds of CCs. If this is the case, be sure to
	  trim the Cc: lines appropriately.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include relevant text from the original message. Trim it to the
	  minimum, but do not overdo it.  It should still be possible for
	  somebody who did not read the original message to understand what
	  you are talking about.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use some technique to identify which text came from the original
	  message, and which text you add.  I personally find that prepending
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; </code></span>”</span> to the original message
	  works best.  Leaving white space after the
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; </code></span>”</span> and leave empty lines
	  between your text and the original text both make the result more
	  readable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Put your response in the correct place (after the text to which
	  it replies).  It is very difficult to read a thread of responses
	  where each reply comes before the text to which it replies.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Most mailers change the subject line on a reply by prepending a
	  text such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Re: </span>”</span>.  If your mailer does not do it
	  automatically, you should do it manually.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the submitter did not abide by format conventions (lines too
	  long, inappropriate subject line), <span class="emphasis"><em>please</em></span> fix
	  it. In the case of an incorrect subject line (such as
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">HELP!!??</span>”</span>), change the subject line to (say)
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Re: Difficulties with sync PPP (was: HELP!!??)</span>”</span>.  That
	  way other people trying to follow the thread will have less
	  difficulty following it.</p><p>In such cases, it is appropriate to say what you did and why you
	  did it, but try not to be rude.  If you find you can not answer
	  without being rude, do not answer.</p><p>If you just want to reply to a message because of its bad
	  format, just reply to the submitter, not to the list.  You can just
	  send him this message in reply, if you like.</p></li></ol></div></div></div></body></html>
