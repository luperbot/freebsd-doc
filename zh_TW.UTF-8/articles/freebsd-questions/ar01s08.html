How to answer a question</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you answer a question to FreeBSD-questions, consider:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>A lot of the points on submitting questions also apply to
	  answering questions.  Read them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Has somebody already answered the question?  The easiest way to
	  check this is to sort your incoming mail by subject: then
	  (hopefully) you will see the question followed by any answers, all
	  together.</p><p>If somebody has already answered it, it does not automatically
	  mean that you should not send another answer.  But it makes sense to
	  read all the other answers first.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do you have something to contribute beyond what has already been
	  said?  In general, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Yeah, me too</span>”</span> answers do not help
	  much, although there are exceptions, like when somebody is
	  describing a problem he is having, and he does not know whether it is
	  his fault or whether there is something wrong with the hardware or
	  software.  If you do send a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">me too</span>”</span> answer, you should
	  also include any further relevant information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure you understand the question?  Very frequently, the
	  person who asks the question is confused or does not express himself
	  very well.  Even with the best understanding of the system, it is
	  easy to send a reply which does not answer the question.  This
	  does not help: you will leave the person who submitted the question
	  more frustrated or confused than ever.  If nobody else answers, and
	  you are not too sure either, you can always ask for more
	  information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are you sure your answer is correct?
	If not, wait a day or so. If nobody else comes up with a
	better answer, you can still reply and say, for example, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I
	do not know if this is correct, but since nobody else has
	replied, why don't you try replacing your ATAPI CDROM with
	a frog?</span>”</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, reply to the
	  sender and to FreeBSD-questions. Many people on the
	  FreeBSD-questions are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">lurkers</span>”</span>: they learn by reading
	  messages sent and replied to by others. If you take a message which
	  is of general interest off the list, you are depriving these people
	  of their information. Be careful with group replies; lots of people
	  send messages with hundreds of CCs. If this is the case, be sure to
	  trim the Cc: lines appropriately.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include relevant text from the original message. Trim it to the
	  minimum, but do not overdo it.  It should still be possible for
	  somebody who did not read the original message to understand what
	  you are talking about.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use some technique to identify which text came from the original
	  message, and which text you add.  I personally find that prepending
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; </code></span>”</span> to the original message
	  works best.  Leaving white space after the
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">&gt; </code></span>”</span> and leave empty lines
	  between your text and the original text both make the result more
	  readable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Put your response in the correct place (after the text to which
	  it replies).  It is very difficult to read a thread of responses
	  where each reply comes before the text to which it replies.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Most mailers change the subject line on a reply by prepending a
	  text such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Re: </span>”</span>.  If your mailer does not do it
	  automatically, you should do it manually.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the submitter did not abide by format conventions (lines too
	  long, inappropriate subject line), <span class="emphasis"><em>please</em></span> fix
	  it. In the case of an incorrect subject line (such as
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">HELP!!??</span>”</span>), change the subject line to (say)
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Re: Difficulties with sync PPP (was: HELP!!??)</span>”</span>.  That
	  way other people trying to follow the thread will have less
	  difficulty following it.</p><p>In such cases, it is appropriate to say what you did and why you
	  did it, but try not to be rude.  If you find you can not answer
	  without being rude, do not answer.</p><p>If you just want to reply to a message because of its bad
	  format, just reply to the submitter, not to the list.  You can just
	  send him this message in reply, if you like.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s07.html">前一頁</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> </td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">7.
