	(or Euro-ISDN) standard using passive cards.  Some active cards
	are supported where the firmware
	also supports other signaling protocols; this also includes the
	first supported Primary Rate (PRI) ISDN card.</p><p>The <span class="application">isdn4bsd</span> software allows you to connect
	to other ISDN routers using either IP over raw HDLC or by using
	synchronous PPP: either by using kernel PPP with <code class="literal">isppp</code>, a

	B-channels is possible.  A telephone answering machine
	application is also available as well as many utilities such as
	a software 300 Baud modem.</p><p>Some growing number of PC ISDN cards are supported under
	FreeBSD and the reports show that it is successfully used all
	over Europe and in many other parts of the world.</p><p>The passive ISDN cards supported are mostly the ones with
	the Infineon (formerly Siemens) ISAC/HSCX/IPAC ISDN chipsets,
	but also ISDN cards with chips from Cologne Chip (ISA bus only),
	PCI cards with Winbond W6692 chips, some cards with the

	chipset based cards such as the AVM Fritz!Card PCI V.1.0 and the

ISDN Terminal Adapters</h3></div></div></div><p>Terminal adapters (TA), are to ISDN what modems are to regular
	phone lines.</p><a id="idp91069904" class="indexterm"></a><p>Most TA's use the standard Hayes modem AT command set, and can be
	used as a drop in replacement for a modem.</p><p>A TA will operate basically the same as a modem except connection
	and throughput speeds will be much faster than your old modem.  You
	will need to configure <a class="link" href="ppp.html" title="27.3. Using Kernel PPP">PPP</a> exactly the same
	as for a modem setup.  Make sure you set your serial speed as high as
	possible.</p><a id="idp91071824" class="indexterm"></a><p>The main advantage of using a TA to connect to an Internet
	Provider is that you can do Dynamic PPP.  As IP address space becomes
	more and more scarce, most providers are not willing to provide you
	with a static IP anymore.  Most stand-alone routers are not able to
	accommodate dynamic IP allocation.</p><p>TA's completely rely on the PPP daemon that you are running for
	their features and stability of connection.  This allows you to
	upgrade easily from using a modem to ISDN on a FreeBSD machine, if you
	already have PPP set up.  However, at the same time any problems you
	experienced with the PPP program and are going to persist.</p><p>If you want maximum stability, use the kernel <a class="link" href="ppp.html" title="27.3. Using Kernel PPP">PPP</a> option, not the <a class="link" href="userppp.html" title="27.2. Using User PPP">userland PPP</a>.</p><p>The following TA's are known to work with FreeBSD:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Motorola BitSurfer and Bitsurfer Pro</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Adtran</p></li></ul></div><p>Most other TA's will probably work as well, TA vendors try to make
	sure their product can accept most of the standard modem AT command
	set.</p><p>The real problem with external TA's is that, like modems,
	you need a good serial card in your computer.</p><p>You should read the <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/zh_TW.UTF-8/articles/serial-uart/index.html" target="_top">FreeBSD Serial
	Hardware</a> tutorial for a detailed understanding of
	serial devices, and the differences between asynchronous and
	synchronous serial ports.</p><p>A TA running off a standard PC serial port (asynchronous) limits
	you to 115.2 Kbs, even though you have a 128 Kbs connection.
	To fully utilize the 128 Kbs that ISDN is capable of,
	you must move the TA to a synchronous serial card.</p><p>Do not be fooled into buying an internal TA and thinking you have
	avoided the synchronous/asynchronous issue.  Internal TA's simply have
	a standard PC serial port chip built into them.  All this will do is
	save you having to buy another serial cable and find another empty
	electrical socket.</p><p>A synchronous card with a TA is at least as fast as a stand-alone
	router, and with a simple 386 FreeBSD box driving it, probably more
	flexible.</p><p>The choice of synchronous card/TA v.s. stand-alone router is largely a
	religious issue.  There has been some discussion of this in
	the mailing lists.  We suggest you search the <a class="link" href="../../../../search/index.html" target="_top">archives</a> for
	the complete discussion.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp91080784"></a>31.8.3. Stand-alone ISDN Bridges/Routers</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp91081424" class="indexterm"></a><p>ISDN bridges or routers are not at all specific to FreeBSD
	or any other operating system.  For a more complete
	description of routing and bridging technology, please refer
	to a networking reference book.</p><p>In the context of this section, the terms router and bridge will
	be used interchangeably.</p><p>As the cost of low end ISDN routers/bridges comes down, it
	will likely become a more and more popular choice.  An ISDN
	router is a small box that plugs directly into your local
	Ethernet network, and manages its own connection to the other
	bridge/router.  It has built in software to communicate via
	PPP and other popular protocols.</p><p>A router will allow you much faster throughput than a
	standard TA, since it will be using a full synchronous ISDN
	connection.</p><p>The main problem with ISDN routers and bridges is that
	interoperability between manufacturers can still be a problem.
	If you are planning to connect to an Internet provider, you
	should discuss your needs with them.</p><p>If you are planning to connect two LAN segments together,
	such as your home LAN to the office LAN, this is the simplest
	lowest
	maintenance solution.  Since you are buying the equipment for
	both sides of the connection you can be assured that the link
	will work.</p><p>For example to connect a home computer or branch office
	network to a head office network the following setup could be
	used:</p><div class="example"><a id="idp91085520"></a><div class="example-title">範例 31.3. Branch Office or Home Network</div><div class="example-contents"><a id="idp91086160" class="indexterm"></a><p>Network uses a bus based topology with 10 base 2
	  Ethernet (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">thinnet</span>”</span>).  Connect router to network cable with
	  AUI/10BT transceiver, if necessary.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="advanced-networking/isdn-bus.png" alt="10 Base 2 Ethernet" /></div><p>If your home/branch office is only one computer you can use a
	  twisted pair crossover cable to connect to the stand-alone router
	  directly.</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><div class="example"><a id="idp91099088"></a><div class="example-title">範例 31.4. Head Office or Other LAN</div><div class="example-contents"><a id="idp91099728" class="indexterm"></a><p>Network uses a star topology with 10 base T Ethernet
  	  (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Twisted Pair</span>”</span>).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="advanced-networking/isdn-twisted-pair.png" alt="ISDN Network Diagram" /></div></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>One large advantage of most routers/bridges is that they allow you
	to have 2 <span class="emphasis"><em>separate independent</em></span> PPP connections to
	2 separate sites at the <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> time.  This is not
	supported on most TA's, except for specific (usually expensive) models
	that
	have two serial ports.  Do not confuse this with channel bonding, MPP,
	etc.</p><p>This can be a very useful feature if, for example, you
	have an dedicated ISDN connection at your office and would
	like to tap into it, but do not want to get another ISDN line
	at work.  A router at the office location can manage a
	dedicated B channel connection (64 Kbps) to the Internet
	and use the other B channel for a separate data connection.
	The second B channel can be used for dial-in, dial-out or
	dynamically bonding (MPP, etc.) with the first B channel for
	more bandwidth.</p><a id="idp91113808" class="indexterm"></a><p>An Ethernet bridge will also allow you to transmit more than just
	IP traffic.  You can also send IPX/SPX or whatever other protocols you
	use.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="network-diskless.html">前一頁</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="advanced-networking.html">上一層</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="network-natd.html">下一頁</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">31.7.
