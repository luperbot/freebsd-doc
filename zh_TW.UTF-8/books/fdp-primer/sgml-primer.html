    如何閱讀、理解這些 SGML 原稿，以及本文件中所運用的各項 SGML 技巧。</p><p>本節部分靈感啟發來自 Mark Galassi 的這篇 <a class="link" href="http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/docbook-intro/docbook-intro.html" target="_top">Get Going With DocBook</a>。</p><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sgml-primer-overview"></a>3.1. 簡介</h2></div></div></div><p>Way back when, electronic text was simple to deal with.  Admittedly,
      you had to know which character set your document was written in (ASCII,
      EBCDIC, or one of a number of others) but that was about it.  Text was
      text, and what you saw really was what you got.  No frills, no
      formatting, no intelligence.</p><p>Inevitably, this was not enough.  Once you have text in a
      machine-usable format, you expect machines to be able to use it and
      manipulate it intelligently.  You would like to indicate that certain
      phrases should be emphasized, or added to a glossary, or be hyperlinks.
      You might want filenames to be shown in a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">typewriter</span>”</span> style
      font for viewing on screen, but as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">italics</span>”</span> when printed,
      or any of a myriad of other options for presentation.</p><p>It was once hoped that Artificial Intelligence (AI) would make this
      easy.  Your computer would read in the document and automatically
      identify key phrases, filenames, text that the reader should type in,
      examples, and more.  Unfortunately, real life has not happened quite
      like that, and our computers require some assistance before they can
      meaningfully process our text.</p><p>More precisely, they need help identifying what is what.  You or I
      can look at

      </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>To remove <code class="filename">/tmp/foo</code> use <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rm&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rm</span>(1)</span></a>.</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>rm /tmp/foo</code></strong></pre></blockquote></div><p>

      and easily see which parts are filenames, which are commands to be typed
      in, which parts are references to manual pages, and so on.  But the
      computer processing the document cannot.  For this we need
      markup.</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Markup</span>”</span> is commonly used to describe <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">adding
      value</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">increasing cost</span>”</span>.  The term takes on both
      these meanings when applied to text.  Markup is additional text included
      in the document, distinguished from the document's content in some way,
      so that programs that process the document can read the markup and use
      it when making decisions about the document.  Editors can hide the
      markup from the user, so the user is not distracted by it.</p><p>The extra information stored in the markup <span class="emphasis"><em>adds
      value</em></span> to the document.  Adding the markup to the document
      must typically be done by a person——after all, if computers could
      recognize the text sufficiently well to add the markup then there would
      be no need to add it in the first place.  This <span class="emphasis"><em>increases the
      cost</em></span> (i.e., the effort required) to create the
      document.</p><p>The previous example is actually represented in this document like
      this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;para&gt;To remove &lt;filename&gt;/tmp/foo&lt;/filename&gt; use &amp;man.rm.1;.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;screen&gt;&amp;prompt.user; &lt;userinput&gt;rm /tmp/foo&lt;/userinput&gt;&lt;/screen&gt;</pre><p>As you can see, the markup is clearly separate from the
      content.</p><p>Obviously, if you are going to use markup you need to define what
      your markup means, and how it should be interpreted.  You will need a
      markup language that you can follow when marking up your
      documents.</p><p>Of course, one markup language might not be enough.  A markup
      language for technical documentation has very different requirements
      than a markup language that was to be used for cookery recipes.  This,
      in turn, would be very different from a markup language used to describe
      poetry.  What you really need is a first language that you use to write
      these other markup languages.  A <span class="emphasis"><em>meta markup
      language</em></span>.</p><p>This is exactly what the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
      is.  Many markup languages have been written in SGML, including the two
      most used by the FDP, HTML and DocBook.</p><p>Each language definition is more properly called a Document Type
      Definition (DTD).  The DTD specifies the name of the elements that can
      be used, what order they appear in (and whether some markup can be used
      inside other markup) and related information.  A DTD is sometimes
      referred to as an <span class="emphasis"><em>application</em></span> of SGML.</p><p><a id="sgml-primer-validating"></a>A DTD is a <span class="emphasis"><em>complete</em></span>
      specification of all the elements that are allowed to appear, the order
      in which they should appear, which elements are mandatory, which are
      optional, and so forth. This makes it possible to write an SGML
      <span class="emphasis"><em>parser</em></span> which reads in both the DTD and a document
      which claims to conform to the DTD.  The parser can then confirm whether
      or not all the elements required by the DTD are in the document in the
      right order, and whether there are any errors in the markup.  This is
      normally referred to as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">validating  the document</span>”</span>.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">注意: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This processing simply confirms that the choice of elements, their
	ordering, and so on, conforms to that listed in the DTD.  It does
	<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> check that you have used
	<span class="emphasis"><em>appropriate</em></span> markup for the content.  If you
	tried to mark up all the filenames in your document as function
	names, the parser would not flag this as an error (assuming, of
	course, that your DTD defines elements for filenames and functions,
	and that they are allowed to appear in the same place).</p></div><p>It is likely that most of your contributions to the Documentation
      Project will consist of content marked up in either HTML or DocBook,
      rather than alterations to the DTDs.  For this reason this book will
      not touch on how to write a DTD.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="tools-optional.html">前一頁</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sgml-primer-elements.html">下一頁</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2.2. 輔助工具 </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">起始頁</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3.2.
