-  The BSD license is preferable for transferring research results in a
   way that will widely be deployed and most benefit an economy. As
   such, research funding agencies, such as the NSF, ONR and DARPA,
   should encourage in the earliest phases of funded research projects,
   the adoption of BSD style licenses for software, data, results, and
   open hardware. They should also encourage formation of standards
   based around implemented Open Source systems and ongoing Open Source
   projects.

-  Government policy should minimize the costs and difficulties in
   moving from research to deployment. When possible, grants should
   require results to be available under a commercialization friendly
   BSD style license.

-  In many cases, the long-term results of a BSD style license more
   accurately reflect the goals proclaimed in the research charter of
   universities then what occurs when results are copyrighted or
   patented and subject to proprietary university licensing. Anecdotal
   evidence exists that universities are financially better rewarded in
   the long run by releasing research results and then appealing to
   donations from commercially successful alumni.

-  Companies have long recognized that the creation of de facto
   standards is a key marketing technique. The BSD license serves this
   role well, if a company really has a unique advantage in evolving the
   system. The license is legally attractive to the widest audience
   while the company's expertise ensures their control. There are times
   when the GPL may be the appropriate vehicle for an attempt to create
   such a standard, especially when attempting to undermine or co-opt
   others. The GPL, however, penalizes the evolution of that standard,
   because it promotes a suite rather than a commercially applicable
   standard. Use of such a suite constantly raises commercialization and
   legal issues. It may not be possible to mix standards when some are
   under the GPL and others are not. A true technical standard should
   not mandate exclusion of other standards for non-technical reasons.

-  Companies interested in promoting an evolving standard, which can
   become the core of other companies' commercial products, should be
   wary of the GPL. Regardless of the license used, the resulting
   software will usually devolve to whoever actually makes the majority
   of the engineering changes and most understands the state of the
   system. The GPL simply adds additional legal friction to the result.

-  Large companies, in which Open Source code is developed, should be
   aware that programmers appreciate Open Source because it leaves the
   software available to the employee when they change employers. Some
   companies encourage this behavior as an employment perk, especially
   when the software involved is not directly strategic. It is, in
   effect, a front-loaded retirement benefit with potential lost
   opportunity costs but no direct costs. Encouraging employees to work
   for peer acclaim outside the company is a cheap portable benefit a
   company can sometimes provide with near zero downside.

-  Small companies with software projects vulnerable to orphaning should
   attempt to use the BSD license when possible. Companies of all sizes
   should consider forming such Open Source projects when it is to their
   mutual advantage to maintain the minimal legal and organization
   overheads associated with a true BSD-style Open Source project.

-  Non-profits should participate in Open Source projects when possible.
   To minimize software engineering problems, such as mixing code under
   different licenses, BSD-style licenses should be encouraged. Being
   leery of the GPL should particularly be the case with non-profits
   that interact with the developing world. In some locales where
   application of law becomes a costly exercise, the simplicity of the
   new BSD license, as compared to the GPL, may be of considerable
   advantage.
