The release engineering process for 4.4 formally began on August 1st,
2001. After that date all commits to the ``RELENG_4`` branch of FreeBSD
had to be explicitly approved by the Release Engineering Team
``<re@FreeBSD.org>``. The first release candidate for the x86
architecture was released on August 16, followed by 4 more release
candidates leading up to the final release on September 18th. The
security officer was very involved in the last week of the process as
several security issues were found in the earlier release candidates. A
total of over *500* emails were sent to the Release Engineering Team
``<re@FreeBSD.org>`` in little over a month.

Our user community has made it very clear that the security and
stability of a FreeBSD release should not be sacrificed for any
self-imposed deadlines or target release dates. The FreeBSD Project has
grown tremendously over its lifetime and the need for standardized
release engineering procedures has never been more apparent. This will
become even more important as FreeBSD is ported to new platforms.
