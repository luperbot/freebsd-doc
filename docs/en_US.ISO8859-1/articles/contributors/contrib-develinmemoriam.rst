During the many years that the FreeBSD Project has been in existence,
sadly, some of our developers have passed away. Here are some
remembrances.

*In rough reverse chronological order of their passing:*

.. raw:: html

   <div class="itemizedlist">

-  Alexander Botero-Lowry ``<alexbl@FreeBSD.org>`` (2006 - 2011; RIP
   2012)

   `Alexander <http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?pid=159801494>`__
   was best known as a major contributor to FreeBSD's Python ports and a
   founding member of `FreeBSD Python mailing
   list <http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-python>`__ as
   well as his work on XMMS2.

-  John Birrell ``<jb@FreeBSD.org>`` (1997 - 2009; RIP 2009)

   `John <http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+ogb/In+Memoriam>`__
   made major contributions to FreeBSD, the best known of which is the
   import of the
   `dtrace(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dtrace&sektion=1>`__
   code. John's unique sense of humor and plain-spokenness either
   ruffled feathers or made him quick friends. At the end of his life,
   he had moved to a rural area and was attempting to live with as
   minimal impact to the planet as possible, while at the same time
   still working in the high-tech area.

-  Jean-Marc Zucconi ``<jmz@FreeBSD.org>`` (1994 - 2009; RIP 2009)

   `Jean-Marc <http://www.obs-besancon.fr/article.php3?id_article=323>`__
   was an astrophysicist who made important contributions to the
   modeling of the atmospheres of both planets and comets at
   `l'Observatoire de Besan?on <http://www.obs-besancon.fr/>`__ in
   Besan?on, France. While there, he participated in the conception and
   construction of the Vega tricanal spectrometer that studied Halley's
   Comet. He had also been a long-time contributor to FreeBSD.

-  Jun-ichiro Itoh ``<itojun@FreeBSD.org>`` (1997 - 2001; RIP 2008)

   Known to everyone as
   `itojun <http://astralblue.livejournal.com/350702.html>`__,
   Jun-ichiro Hagino was a core researcher at the `KAME
   Project <http://www.kame.net/>`__, which aimed to provide IPv6 and
   IPsec technology in freely redistributable form. Much of this code
   was incorporated into FreeBSD. Without his efforts, the state of IPv6
   on the Internet would be much different.

-  Cameron Grant ``<cg@FreeBSD.org>`` (1999 - 2005; RIP 2005)

   `Cameron <http://www.dbsi.org/cam/>`__ was a unique individual who
   contributed to the project despite serious physical disabilities. He
   was responsible for a complete rewrite of our sound system during the
   late 1990s. Many of those who corresponded with him had no idea of
   his limited mobility, due to his cheerful spirit and willingness to
   help others.

-  Alan Eldridge ``<alane@FreeBSD.org>`` (2002 - 2003; RIP 2003)

   `Alan <http://freebsd.kde.org/memoriam/alane.php>`__ was a major
   contributor to the KDE on FreeBSD group. In addition, he maintained
   many other difficult and time-consuming ports such as autoconf, CUPS,
   and python. Alan's path was not an easy one but his passion for
   FreeBSD, and dedication to programming excellence, won him many
   friends.
