      which is already well established as your responsibility, then
      there is probably little need to check with other committers
      before jumping in with a commit.  If you see a bug in an area of
      the system which is clearly orphaned (and there are a few such
      areas, to our shame), the same applies.  If, however, you are
      about to modify something which is clearly being actively
      maintained by someone else (and it is only by watching the
      <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>repository</code></em>-committers</code>
      mailing list that you can really get a feel for just what is and
      is not) then consider sending the change to them instead, just
      as you would have before becoming a committer.  For ports, you
      should contact the listed <code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code> in the
      <code class="filename">Makefile</code>.  For other parts of the
      repository, if you are unsure who the active maintainer might
      be, it may help to scan the revision history to see who has
      committed changes in the past.  An example script that lists
      each person who has committed to
      a given file along with the number of commits each person has
      made can be found at on <code class="systemitem">freefall</code> at
      <code class="filename">~eadler/bin/whodid</code>.  If your queries go
      unanswered or the committer otherwise indicates a lack of
      interest in the area affected, go ahead and commit it.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avoid sending private emails to maintainers.  Other people
	might be interested in the conversation, not just the final
	output.</p></div><p>If you are unsure about a commit for any reason at all, have
      it reviewed by <code class="literal">-hackers</code> before committing.
      Better to have it flamed then and there rather than when it is
      part of the repository.  If you do happen to commit something
      which results in controversy erupting, you may also wish to
      consider backing the change out again until the matter is
      settled.  Remember &#8211; with a version control system we can
      always change it back.</p><p>Do not impugn the intentions of someone you disagree with.
      If they see a different solution to a problem than you, or even
      a different problem, it is not because they are stupid, because
      they have questionable parentage, or because they are trying to
      destroy your hard work, personal image, or FreeBSD, but simply
      because they have a different outlook on the world.  Different
      is good.</p><p>Disagree honestly.  Argue your position from its merits,
      be honest about any shortcomings it may have, and be open to
      seeing their solution, or even their vision of the problem,
      with an open mind.</p><p>Accept correction.  We are all fallible.  When you have made
      a mistake, apologize and get on with life.  Do not beat up
      yourself, and certainly do not beat up others for your mistake.
      Do not waste time on embarrassment or recrimination, just fix
      the problem and move on.</p><p>Ask for help.  Seek out (and give) peer reviews.  One of
      the ways open source software is supposed to excel is in the
      number of eyeballs applied to it; this does not apply if nobody
      will review code.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="tracking.license.grants.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="if-in-doubt.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">9. Keeping Track of Licenses Granted to the FreeBSD
