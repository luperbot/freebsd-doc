      function on many different types of hardware architectures.
      Maintaining clean separation of Machine Dependent (MD) and
      Machine Independent (MI) code, as well as minimizing MD code, is
      an important part of our strategy to remain agile with regards
      to current hardware trends.  Each new hardware architecture
      supported by FreeBSD adds substantially to the cost of code
      maintenance, toolchain support, and release engineering.  It
      also dramatically increases the cost of effective testing of
      kernel changes.  As such, there is strong motivation to
      differentiate between classes of support for various
      architectures while remaining strong in a few key architectures
      that are seen as the FreeBSD <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">target audience</span>&#8221;</span>.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp68028368"></a>18.1. Statement of General Intent</h3></div></div></div><p>The FreeBSD Project targets "production quality commercial
	off-the-shelf (COTS) workstation, server, and high-end
	embedded systems".  By retaining a focus on a narrow set of
	architectures of interest in these environments, the FreeBSD
	Project is able to maintain high levels of quality, stability,
	and performance, as well as minimize the load on various
	support teams on the project, such as the ports team,
	documentation team, security officer, and release engineering
	teams.  Diversity in hardware support broadens the options for
	FreeBSD consumers by offering new features and usage
	opportunities (such as support for 64-bit CPUs, use in
	embedded environments, etc.), but these benefits must always
	be carefully considered in terms of the real-world maintenance
	cost associated with additional platform support.</p><p>The FreeBSD Project differentiates platform targets into
	four tiers.  Each tier includes a specification of the
	requirements for an architecture to be in that tier,
	as well as specifying the obligations of developers with
	regards to the platform.  In addition, a policy is defined
	regarding the circumstances required to change the tier
	of an architecture.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp68029904"></a>18.2. Tier 1: Fully Supported Architectures</h3></div></div></div><p>Tier 1 platforms are fully supported by the security
	officer, release engineering, and toolchain maintenance staff.
	New features added to the operating system must be fully
	functional across all Tier 1 architectures for every release
	(features which are inherently architecture-specific, such as
	support for hardware device drivers, may be exempt from this
	requirement).  In general, all Tier 1 platforms must have
	build and Tinderbox support either in the FreeBSD.org cluster,
	or be easily available for all developers.  Embedded platforms
	may substitute an emulator available in the FreeBSD cluster
	for actual hardware.</p><p>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be Production Quality
	with respects to all aspects of the FreeBSD operating system,
	including installation and development environments.</p><p>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be completely
	integrated into the source tree and have all features
	necessary to produce an entire system relevant for that target
	architecture.  Tier 1 architectures generally have at least 6
	active developers.</p><p>Tier 1 architectures are expected to be fully supported by
	the ports system.  All the ports should build on a Tier 1
	platform, or have the appropriate filters to prevent the
	inappropriate ones from building there.  The packaging system
	must support all Tier 1 architectures.  To ensure an
	architecture's Tier 1 status, proponents of that architecture
	must show that all relevant packages can be built on that
	platform.</p><p>Tier 1 embedded architectures must be able to cross-build
	packages on at least one other Tier 1 architecture.  The
	packages must be the most relevant for the platform, but may
	be a non-empty subset of those that build natively.</p><p>Tier 1 architectures must be fully documented.  All basic
	operations need to be covered by the handbook or other
	documents.  All relevant integration documentation must also
	be integrated into the tree, or readily available.</p><p>Current Tier 1 platforms are i386 and
	amd64.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp68033360"></a>18.3. Tier 2: Developmental Architectures</h3></div></div></div><p>Tier 2 platforms are not supported by the security officer
	and release engineering teams.  Platform maintainers are
	responsible for toolchain support in the tree.  The toolchain
	maintainers are expected to work with the platform maintainers
	to refine these changes.  Major new toolchain components are
	allowed to break support for Tier 2 architectures if the
	FreeBSD-local changes have not been incorporated upstream.
	The toolchain maintainers are expected to provide prompt
	review of any proposed changes and cannot block, through their
	inaction, changes going into the tree.  New features added to
	FreeBSD should be feasible to implement on these platforms,
	but an implementation is not required before the feature may
	be added to the FreeBSD source tree.  New features that may be
	difficult to implement on Tier 2 architectures should provide
	a means of disabling them on those architectures.  The
	implementation of a Tier 2 architecture may be committed to
	the main FreeBSD tree as long as it does not interfere with
	production work on Tier 1 platforms, or substantially with
	other Tier 2 platforms.  Before a Tier 2 platform can be added
	to the FreeBSD base source tree, the platform must be able to
	boot multi-user on actual hardware.  Generally, there must be
	at least three active developers working on the
	platform.</p><p>Tier 2 architectures are usually systems targeted at Tier
	1 support, but that are still under development.
	Architectures reaching end of life may also be moved from Tier
	1 status to Tier 2 status as the availability of resources to
	continue to maintain the system in a Production Quality state
	diminishes.  Well supported niche architectures may also be
	Tier 2.</p><p>Tier 2 architectures have basic support for them
	integrated into the ports infrastructure.  They may have cross
	compilation support added, at the discretion of portmgr.  Some
	ports must built natively into packages if the package system
	supports that architecture.  If not integrated into the base
	system, some external patches for the architecture for ports
	must be available.</p><p>Tier 2 architectures can be integrated into the FreeBSD
	handbook.  The basics for how to get a system running must be
	documented, although not necessarily for every single board or
	system a Tier 2 architecture supports.  The supported hardware
	list must exist and should be relatively recent.  It should be
	integrated into the FreeBSD documentation.</p><p>Current Tier 2 platforms are arm, ia64
	(through FreeBSD 10),
	pc98, powerpc, and sparc64.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp68040272"></a>18.4. Tier 3: Experimental Architectures</h3></div></div></div><p>Tier 3 platforms are not supported by the security officer
	and release engineering teams.  At the discretion of the
	toolchain maintainers, they may be supported in the toolchain.
	Tier 3 platforms are architectures in the early stages of
	development, for non-mainstream hardware platforms, or which
	are considered legacy systems unlikely to see broad future
	use.  Initial support for Tier 3 platforms should be worked on
	in external SCM repositories.
	The transition to FreeBSD's subversion should take place after
	the platform boots multi-user on hardware; sharing via
	subversion is needed for wider exposure; and multiple
	developers are actively working on the platform.
	Platforms that transition to Tier 3 status may be
	removed from the tree if they are no longer actively supported
	by the FreeBSD developer community at the discretion of the
	release engineer.</p><p>Tier 3 platforms may have ports support, either integrated
	or external, but do not require it.</p><p>Tier 3 platforms must have the basics documented for how
	to build a kernel and how to boot it on at least one target
	hardware or emulation environment.  This documentation need
	not be integrated into the FreeBSD tree.</p><p>Current Tier 3 platforms are mips.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp68042576"></a>18.5. Tier 4: Unsupported Architectures</h3></div></div></div><p>Tier 4 systems are not supported in any form by the
