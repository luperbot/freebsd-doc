Participation in the mailing lists, like participation in any community,
requires a common basis for communication. Many of the mailing lists
presuppose a knowledge of the Project's history. In particular, there
are certain topics that seem to regularly occur to newcomers to the
community. It is the responsibility of each poster to ensure that their
postings do not fall into one of these categories. By doing so, you will
help the mailing lists to stay on-topic, and probably save yourself
being flamed in the process.

The best method to avoid this is to familiarize yourself with the
`mailing list archives <http://docs.FreeBSD.org/mail/>`__, to help
yourself understand the background of what has gone before. In this, the
`mailing list search
interface <http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists>`__ is
invaluable. (If that method does not yield useful results, please
supplement it with a search with your favorite major search engine).

By familiarizing yourself with the archives, not only will you learn
what topics have been discussed before, but also how discussion tends to
proceed on that list, who the participants are, and who the target
audience is. These are always good things to know before you post to any
mailing list, not just a FreeBSD mailing list.

There is no doubt that the archives are quite extensive, and some
questions recur more often than others, sometimes as followups where the
subject line no longer accurately reflects the new content.
Nevertheless, the burden is on you, the poster, to do your homework to
help avoid these recurring topics.
