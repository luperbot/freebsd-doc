Proposing Committers
====================

The following advice is intended for potential mentors in deciding
whether a candidate might be suitable to propose for a commit bit, and
in preparing a commit-bit proposal for consideration by the Core Team or
its delegates. Note that in the case of delegated approval (e.g., to
Portmgr or Doceng), additional procedures or constraints may apply
(e.g., to the nature of the contribution).

Commit-bit proposal reviewers will look for several key attributes from
potential developers: strong technical abilities, a track record of
contributions to the FreeBSD Project, evidence of their ability to work
independently within the community (i.e., that mentoring will not need
to continue indefinitely), evidence of the ability of a developer to
engage constructively with the FreeBSD community (and in particular,
have the social skills to navigate occasionally heated online debate),
and a commitment to contribute to the project in the future. Typically,
supporting material for a commit-bit proposal will include a description
of the candidate's background and training/education, the context for
their contributions to the project (e.g., as a volunteer, employee,
etc), references to patches/PRs/commits justifying their contribution
track record, pointers at mailing-list or other community participation
(e.g., presentations at BSD conferences), a strong indication of
constructive engagement with their mentor to date, and a list of
interests and potential areas of continuing and future contribution.

Potential mentors are reminded that it is far easier to grant commit
access than revoke it, and hence significant weight is given to
constructive interaction with the community, rather than simply
technical contributions. If a mentor is uncertain as to whether a
candidate is suitable, it may be sensible to initially contact the Core
Team via an informal request for guidance rather than a formal proposal
-- this might lead to advice to continue, requests for further
supporting material, or the suggestion that a proposal should be
deferred while further track record is accrued. It is hoped that
requests to gain further experience or to generate additional evidence
of community participation and contribution will be taken in the spirit
that they are intended: granting of a commit bit is a significant action
and based in large part on work performed, rather than simply strong
technical abilities. The project would rather take a conservative
approach in granting commit rights than grant them prematurely.

In some cases, 'vendor commit bits' may be granted to allow direct
commits to device drivers (or potentially other components) maintained
by, for example, a device vendor. These may be held to a lower standard
of past community involvement based on a strong commitment by the vendor
and an experienced mentor, as well as limited charter to make changes in
the system independently. It is extremely important that such commit
bits be used with suitable discretion and awareness of community
concerns; it is the responsibility of the mentor to ensure that no
undesirable tension arises, and that changes are in keeping with project
procedures and community expectations. If a commit bit is granted in
this context, it may be revoked when the individual leaves their
employer; however, there is also a substantial history of individuals
with 'vendor commit bits' making more broad contributions and this is
the hoped for outcome! Mentors proposing vendor commit bits should take
all steps necessary to ensure that commit bits are granted only to
individuals who can take responsibility for the quality and testing of
contributions they make on behalf of the vendor, and have the necessary
technical and social skills to engage constructively with the community.
It is recommended that proposals for such bits contain to the greatest
extent the same content as expected of ordinary commit bits, with a
particular focus on quality of technical contribution.
