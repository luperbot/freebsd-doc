Software License Policy
=======================

Philosophy
----------

The FreeBSD Project aims to produce a complete, BSD-licensed operating
system allowing consumers of the system to produce derivative products
without constraint or further license obligations. We invite and greatly
appreciate the contribution of both changes and additions under the
two-clause BSD license, and encourage the adoption of this license by
other open source projects. Use of the BSD license is key to encouraging
the adoption of advanced operating system technology, and on many
notable occasions has been pivotal to widespread use of new technology.

We accept however that compelling reasons exist to allow
differently-licensed software to be included in the FreeBSD source tree.

We require any software under alternative licenses to be carefully
isolated in the source tree so that it cannot contaminate BSD-only
components. Such cautious management encourages licensing clarity and
facilitates the production of BSD-only derivative products.

Unless a special exception is made, no existing BSD-licensed components
may be replaced with differently-licensed software. We instead encourage
FreeBSD and third party developers to seek the relicensing or
reimplementation of critical components under the BSD license. Such
would ease their more integral adoption into the FreeBSD operating
system.

Policy
------

-  The import of new software licensed under any licenses other than the
   BSD license and BSD-Like Licenses (as defined below) requires the
   prior approval of the FreeBSD Core Team. Requests for import must
   include:

   -  A list of features or bug fixes that the new version or patches
      contain, along with evidence that our users need those features.
      PRs or references to mailing list discussions are ideal forms of
      evidence.

      This process should be used for all software imports, not just
      those that require Core Team review. The mere existence of a new
      version does not justify an import of software to source or ports.

   -  A list of FreeBSD branches that may be affected. Expansions of
      scope require a new request to and approval from the FreeBSD Core
      Team.

-  We will allow existing GPLv2 licensed software to be converted to
   GPLv3 or other similar license changes on a case-by-case basis
   provided that the FreeBSD Core Team is given appropriate technical
   justification.

   Each piece of software that is being converted to a different license
   must be submitted to the FreeBSD Core Team for approval through this
   process as though it were a new piece of software.

   For Free Software Foundation maintained software except GCC, GDB, and
   binutils, all patches posted after the date the software switched to
   GPLv3 will be considered to be covered by the GPLv3 and thus will be
   subject to this rule. For GCC, GDB and binutils we accept the
   community practice of allowing patches to be relicensed under GPLv2
   at the patch author's discretion. The author's permission must be
   documented in the commit message for each patch that is committed.

Acceptable licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following licenses are considered to be acceptable BSD-Like Licenses
for the purpose of this Policy. They must be reproduced verbatim on any
new code. Deviations or the use of any other license must be approved by
the FreeBSD Core Team:
