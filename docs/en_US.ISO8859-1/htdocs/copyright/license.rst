    July 22, 1999

    To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:

    As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD")
    source code files require that further distributions of products
    containing all or portions of the software, acknowledge within their
    advertising materials that such products contain software developed
    by UC Berkeley and its contributors.

    Specifically, the provision reads:

    ::

        "     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
              *    must display the following acknowledgement:
              *    This product includes software developed by the University of
              *    California, Berkeley and its contributors."

    Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer
    required to include the acknowledgement within advertising
    materials. Accordingly, the foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix
    files containing it is hereby deleted in its entirety.
