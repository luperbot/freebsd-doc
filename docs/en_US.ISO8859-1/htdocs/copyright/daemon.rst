The BSD Daemon
==============

The little red fellow that graces many of these pages is the BSD Daemon.
In the context of UNIX? systems, daemons are process that run in the
background attending to various tasks without human intervention. In the
general sense, daemon is an older form of the word demon. In the *Unix
System Administration Handbook*, Evi Nemeth has this to say about
daemons:

    "Many people equate the word \`\`daemon'' with the word \`\`demon,''
    implying some kind of Satanic connection between UNIX and the
    underworld. This is an egregious misunderstanding. \`\`Daemon'' is
    actually a much older form of \`\`demon''; daemons have no
    particular bias towards good or evil, but rather serve to help
    define a person's character or personality. The ancient Greeks'
    concept of a \`\`personal daemon'' was similar to the modern concept
    of a \`\`guardian angel'' --- \`\`eudaemonia'' is the state of being
    helped or protected by a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX systems seem
    to be infested with both daemons and demons." (p403)

The earliest (and most popular) renditions of the BSD Daemon were
created by John Lasseter. More recent FreeBSD-specific renditions have
done by `Tatsumi Hosokawa <http://FromTo.Cc/hosokawa/gallery/>`__, but
the basic inspiration was definitely John's. The copyright holder and
creator of the daemon image is `Marshall Kirk
McKusick <mailto:mckusick@mckusick.com>`__. A short `pictorial
history <http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/index.html>`__ is also
available. There is a gallery of FreeBSD related
`publications <../publish.html>`__ that use variations of the daemon
graphic.

Various size stuffed and beanie daemons are available from `the FreeBSD
Mall <http://www.freebsdmall.com>`__ |beanie daemon|.
