FreeBSD Summer Projects
=======================

The FreeBSD Project is looking forward to participating as a mentoring
organization in `Google Summer of
Code <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015>`__
2015. This program funds students $5,500 USD to contribute to an open
source project over the summer break. We have had over 170 successful
students working on FreeBSD as part of this program in
`2005 <../projects/summerofcode-2005.html>`__,
`2006 <../projects/summerofcode-2006.html>`__,
`2007 <../projects/summerofcode-2007.html>`__,

Benefit of Participating
------------------------

Google Summer of Code is an exciting opportunity for students to
"intern" with an open source project for a summer. The FreeBSD Project,
as one of the most successful and oldest open source projects, is an
excellent place to do this internship. Founded in 1993, the project now
consists of several hundred "committers" and tens of thousands of
contributors. FreeBSD is the foundation for many commercial products,
including Apple's Mac OS X, NetApp's OnTap/GX, Juniper's JunOS, as well
countless other products, and is widely used in the Internet Service
Provider and corporate IT worlds. Many of these sponsors participate
daily in the FreeBSD community, and students have the opportunity to
develop software ideas in an exciting environment with many real world
applications, and under the mentorship of experienced developers.

After the summer ends, students can be sponsored by Google or the
FreeBSD Foundation to attend operating systems and open source
conferences to present on their work, and a significant number go on to
become FreeBSD developers. It's also a great job networking opportunity!

Example Proposal Ideas
----------------------

The FreeBSD Project maintains a `list of possible
ideas <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCodeIdeas>`__ on our wiki. All
projects listed are believed to be sized for a useful summer hacking,
and have technical contacts who can help answer questions as you write
your proposal. We also maintain a more generic `Ideas
Page <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/IdeasPage>`__. These projects are less
suitable as Summer of Code projects as they may be scoped larger or
smaller than a summer, or might not have such a clear mentor â€” we
suggest e-mailing our soc-admins alias for help if you do decide to
propose one of them. These pages exist to help provide inspiration.
Students are also welcome, and are indeed encouraged to propose your own
ideas, and if the proposal is strong, we'll try to match you with a
mentor!

For additional ideas about upcoming development projects in FreeBSD,
take a look at recent `Developer Status Reports <../news/status>`__.

Proposal Guidelines
-------------------

Students are responsible for writing a proposal and submitting it to
Google before the application deadline. The following outline was
adapted from the Perl Foundation. The objective of the proposal is to
identify what is to be done, explain why this needs to be done, and
convince us that:

-  You are qualified to do this project. This means both having the
   necessary background and demonstrating a general understanding of the
   problem.
-  You have the resources (especially time!) needed to complete the
   project within the working period of the Summer of Code.

A strong proposal will include (at least):

General Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Name**

-  **Email**

-  **Phone**

-  **IM/IRC**

-  **Availability**

   How many hours per week will you spend working on this? How many on
   other things? What other obligations (work, school, vacation,
   weddings, etc.) do you have this summer? Be as specific as possible:
   when will the project begin and end? You should be ready to produce a
   day by day schedule before the program starts.)

   **Please note**: participating in Google Summer of Code is a
   significant time commitment, and you should not apply if you already
   have another full-time job planned for the summer.

-  **Biography**

   Who are you? What skills do you bring to this project? What is your
   past involvement with The FreeBSD Project? (Past involvement is not
   required, but ideally you will have at least installed FreeBSD and
   perhaps fixed a bug or two) If your project includes programming in a
   particular language, such as C, or in a specific environment, such as
   the kernel or an embedded platform, what experience do you have
   working in that area? Are you familiar with or a user of revision
   control systems? Have you completed courses that will be relevant to
   your project idea? What do you think you will need to learn to
   complete this project?

-  **Possible Mentor**

   Optional, but highly recommended. Do not put a name here if you have
   not contacted them.

Project Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Project Title**

   In forty characters or less, what you propose to do.

-  **Project Description**

   A few paragraphs describing your project. Direct copies from the
   ideas page will be rejected - proposals should reveal that you have
   done some research into the problem and its solutions. Include both
   what you will be doing and why it is a good thing for The FreeBSD
   Project.

-  **Deliverables**

   A list quantifiable results and related code milestones. We suggest
   at least two milestones before the mid-term evaluations and two
   after. Where appropriate, this schedule should include multiple
   committable or releasable points so people can benefit from and/or
   test your work as early as possible.

-  **Test Plan**

   What parts of your code need testing and how do you plan to test
   them? This might include both functionality and performance tests.

-  **Project Schedule**

   How long will the project take? When can you begin work?

Mentors
-------

A number of FreeBSD committers are willing to mentor students. A good
place to start is the 'Technical contacts' listed with the example
projects on the `ideas
page <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCodeIdeas>`__.

Infrastructure Provided to Students
-----------------------------------

In previous years, the FreeBSD Project provided access to FreeBSD
Subversion and Perforce revision control infrastructure in order to
facilitate student collaboration, provide public access and archiving
for the on-going student projects, and to help mentors and the community
monitor on-going work. It is expected that students participating in
future programs will be offered the same facilities. Students will also
be asked to maintain wiki pages on their on-going projects. In the past,
e-mail, IRC, and instant messaging have proven popular among students
and mentors, and students participating in the FreeBSD summer program
are encouraged to use these and other electronic communication
mechanisms to become active in the community.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

-  **When are proposals due, and how do I submit mine?**

   At the time of writing, Google has announced the following dates of
   interest relating to the application process:

   -  **16 March** - Student application period opens.

   -  **27 March 19:00 UTC** - Student application period closes.

   -  **27 April** - Accepted students announced, students start
      creating their work plans.

   -  **25 May** - Coding starts.

   -  **17 August** - Suggested end of coding.

   Note that these dates may change, and the Google FAQ timeline is the
   authoritative source of detailed schedule information:

   -  `GSoC 2015
      Timeline <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2015>`__

   All students must register with, and submit applications via, the
   Google Summer of Code home page:

   -  `Google Summer of Code Home
      Page <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015>`__

-  **What advice do you have for a student who might want to submit a
   proposal?**

   Experience suggests that the strongest proposals come from students
   who contact FreeBSD developers and potential mentors well in advance
   of submitting their proposal, seek feedback on their proposal ideas,
   and write proposals that reflect time spent exploring and
   understanding the problem area to be addressed. Even if the FreeBSD
   developer(s) you contact aren't the eventual mentor of the project,
   their feedback can be invaluable.

-  **Can I submit multiple project proposals to the FreeBSD Project?**

   Yes, but do make sure you invest adequate time in each proposal. We
   are not able to accept more than one project per student, so you may
   do better spending more time on one or two detailed proposals than by
   submitting lots of less-detailed ones.

-  **Will the FreeBSD Project accept more than one student for the same
   idea?**

   In general, we will accept only one student for any given proposal
   idea, as most proposal ideas in our ideas list are sized with a
   single student summer project in mind. This is a good reason to
   consider coming up with your own idea, or at least, making sure that
   your proposal for one of our project ideas reflects your unique
   contribution and viewpoint. If you plan to submit multiple proposals,
   you might consider doing one with an idea from the list, and another
   with an original idea.

-  **What if my proposal is not selected in the application process? Can
   I still participate?**

   We always have more good applications than student places, but that
   doesn't mean you can't do the project anyway. The FreeBSD Project
   always welcomes new volunteers to work on projects, and is generally
   happy to provide mentoring and support for students whose proposals
   could not be selected in order to allow them to work on their project
   anyway. You will need to work with the FreeBSD Project GSoC
   administrators to identify a possible mentor. However, Google will
   not fund that participation.

-  **What projects were completed successfully by students in previous
   summers?**

   Please see the `2014 FreeBSD Summer of Code
   page <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2014Projects>`__, as well
   as older project pages from
   `2013 <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2013Projects>`__,
   `2012 <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2012Projects>`__,
   `2011 <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2011Projects>`__,
   `2010 <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2010Projects>`__,
   `2009 <https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2009Projects>`__,
   `2008 <summerofcode-2008.html>`__, `2007 <summerofcode-2007.html>`__,
   `2006 <summerofcode-2006.html>`__, and
   `2005 <summerofcode-2005.html>`__ for a list of the completed
   projects from previous years.

-  **How can I learn more about FreeBSD?**

   The `FreeBSD Project Home Page <//www.FreeBSD.org/>`__ is the best
   way to learn more about the project â€” from there you can reach the
   FreeBSD Handbook, FreeBSD Developer's Handbook, project mailing list
   archives, regular project status reports, and more. If you have
   questions about specific project ideas, e-mail the technical contacts
   for those ideas. If you have general GSoC questions relating to
   FreeBSD, such as if you are unable to reach a project technical
   contact, need help finding documentation, or want to know who might
   be a good person to talk to about your idea, send them to
   soc-admins@FreeBSD.org.

-  **Is there an IRC channel I can join to talk about proposal ideas or
   get help finding out more?**

   You can join #freebsd-soc on the efnet IRC network to chat with
   FreeBSD developers interested in mentoring student proposals and
   projects, past FreeBSD/GSoC students, and other students applying to
   FreeBSD/GSoC this year.
