Resources for Newbies
=====================

The following resources are some of those which FreeBSD newbies have
found most helpful when learning to use FreeBSD. Please send corrections
and additions to
`FreeBSD-doc@FreeBSD.org <mailto:freebsd-doc@FreeBSD.org>`__.

-  `Using the FreeBSD web site <#web-site>`__
-  `Learning about FreeBSD <#fbsd>`__
-  `Learning about FreeBSD-derived projects <#derived>`__
-  `Learning about UNIX? <#unix>`__
-  `Learning about the X Window System <#xwin>`__
-  `Helping other people <#people>`__

Using the FreeBSD web site
--------------------------

This web site is the main source of up to date information about
FreeBSD. Newbies have found the following pages particularly helpful:

-  `Search <../search/search.html>`__ the Handbook and FAQ, the whole
   web site, or the FreeBSD mailing list archives.

-  The `Documentation <../docs.html>`__ page has links to the Handbook
   and FAQ, tutorials, information about contributing to the
   Documentation Project, documents in languages other than English,
   online manual pages, and much more.

-  The `Support <../support.html>`__ page contains a wealth of
   information about FreeBSD, including mailing lists, user groups, web
   and FTP sites, release information, and links to some sources of
   UNIX? information.

Learning about FreeBSD
----------------------

-  You should most probably look for the `latest mainstream
   release <../releases/10.1R/announce.html>`__. (See the Handbook for
   why you should **not** be tempted by any of the other branches.)
   Before you begin, carefully read the `installation
   instructions <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/install.html>`__,
   as well as each one of the \*.TXT files in the FTP directory or on
   the installation CD. They are there because they contain information
   that you will need. Also pick up the latest `errata
   file <../releases/index.html>`__ from the web site, in case it has
   been updated.

-  A number of `short articles and
   tutorials <../docs/books.html#ARTICLES>`__ are available. The short
   tutorial, `For People New to Both FreeBSD and
   Unix <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/new-users/index.html>`__, is
   popular with absolute beginners. You do not have to know much about
   anything to enjoy this one.

-  There is a lot of documentation to help for setting up ppp. You might
   start with the `PPP and
   SLIP <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ppp-and-slip.html>`__
   chapter of the FreeBSD Handbook and explore the `ppp
   page <http://www.awfulhak.org/ppp.html>`__ for links to the other
   valuable information and the latest updates.

-  The `FreeBSD
   Handbook <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html>`__ and
   `Frequently Asked Questions
   (FAQ) <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/index.html>`__ are the main
   documents for FreeBSD. Essential reading, they contain a lot of
   material for newbies as well as some pretty advanced stuff. Do not
   worry if you are unable to understand the advanced sections. The
   handbook contains the installation instructions and also provides
   lists of books and on-line resources, and the FAQ has a
   troubleshooting section.

-  Join the FreeBSD-Questions mailing list to see the questions you were
   too afraid to ask, and their answers. Subscribe by filling out the
   following form:
   http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions. You can
   look up old questions and answers via the
   `search <../search/search.html#mailinglists>`__ page.

-  The main newsgroup for FreeBSD is
   `comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.misc <news:comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.misc>`__.
   General UNIX questions are dealt with in the newsgroup
   `comp.unix.questions <news:comp.unix.questions>`__ and the associated
   `FAQ <ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/faq/>`__
   from the RMIT FTP site. Newbies are likely to be most interested in
   sections 1 and 2 initially.

-  `Manual pages <//www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi>`__ are good for
   reference but not always the best introduction for a novice. The more
   you work with man pages the more familiar they become. Some are very
   good for newbies, so always check them out. The ppp man page, for
   example, is more like a tutorial.

Learning about FreeBSD-derived projects
---------------------------------------

FreeBSD is widely used as a building block for other commercial and
open-source operating systems. Some of the most widely used and publicly
available systems are listed below.

-  `PC-BSD <http://www.pcbsd.org>`__ is a FreeBSD derivative with a
   graphical installer and impressive desktop tools aimed at ease of use
   for the casual computer user.

-  Apple's `Mac OS X <http://www.apple.com/macosx>`__ is `based in
   part <http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/technology/unix.html>`__ on
   FreeBSD and includes a rich UNIX? foundation in addition to the
   proprietary Apple user interface.

Learning about UNIX?
--------------------

Many of the problems we have as newbies come from being unfamiliar with
the UNIX commands, needed to fix our FreeBSD problems. Without a UNIX
background you will be faced with two things to learn at once.
Fortunately a lot of resources are available to make this easier.

-  The `UNIX?
   Basics <../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/basics.html>`__ chapter
   of the FreeBSD Handbook covers the basic commands and functionality
   of FreeBSD operating system. Most of information provided in this
   document is also relevant for any other UNIX?-like operating system.

-  There are many easy books, such as the "Dummies" guides, in any large
   book shop. If you want something really easy, take a look at what is
   available and pick one that seems to speak your language. Pretty soon
   you will want to move on to a book that gives more coverage.

-  Another popular book is *UNIX Power Tools* by Jerry Peek, Tim
   O'Reilly and Mike Loukides, published by O'Reilly and Associates. It
   is organized as a series of short articles each of which solves a
   problem, and these articles are cross-referenced to other articles
   with related material. Though not specifically aimed at newbies, the
   design makes it ideal for a newbie with a burning question or the odd
   few minutes to browse. More elementary material is near the front of
   the book, but there are short easy articles throughout.

-  A `UNIX Introductory
   Course <http://www.cs.duke.edu/csl/docs/unix_course/>`__ from Ohio
   State University is available online in HTML format.

-  A `UNIX System Administration
   Course <http://www.cs.duke.edu/csl/docs/sysadmin_course/>`__ from
   Ohio State University is available online in HTML format.

-  `UNIXhelp for Users <http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/unixhelp/>`__ is
   another introductory guide which is available in HTML at a mirror
   site near you, or can be installed on your own system.

-  Many other web sites hold lists of UNIX tutorials and reference
   material. One of the best places to start looking is the little known
   search engine `Google <https://google.com>`__.

Learning about the X Window System
----------------------------------

The X Window System is used with a number of operating systems,
including FreeBSD. The documentation for X can be found at the `X.Org
Foundation <http://www.x.org/>`__ web site. Beware, much of this
documentation is reference material which is more likely to be difficult
for newcomers to digest.

-  Before you can get X running exactly the way you like, you will need
   to choose a window manager. Visit the `Window Managers for
   X <http://xwinman.org/>`__ page and follow the link to the
   introduction to find out about window managers, then return and read
   "The Basics". Then go back and compare the different types that are
   available. (Bonus: there is another beginners guide to UNIX there
   too.) Most, if not all, of these window managers are available to
   install from the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

Helping other people
--------------------

Everyone has something to contribute to the FreeBSD community, even
newbies! Some are busy working with the new advocacy group and some have
become involved with the `Documentation
Project <../docproj/docproj.html>`__ as reviewers. Other FreeBSD newbies
might have particular skills and experiences to share, either computer
related or not, or just want to meet new newbies and make them feel
welcome. There are always people around who help others simply because
they like to.

Friends who run FreeBSD are a great resource. No book can replace
chatting on the phone or across a pizza with someone who has the same
interests, enjoys similar accomplishments, and faces the same
challenges. If you do not have many friends who use FreeBSD, consider
using your old FreeBSD CDs to create some more.

`User groups <../usergroups.html>`__ are good places to meet other
FreeBSD users. If there is no one nearby, you might consider starting
one!

Before talking to real humans about your new skills, you might want to
check the `Jargon File <http://www.catb.org/jargon/>`__.
