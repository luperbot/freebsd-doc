A project model is a means to reduce the communications overhead in a
project. As shown by [`Brooks, 1995 <bibliography.html#brooks>`__],
increasing the number of project participants increases the
communication in the project exponentionally. FreeBSD has during the
past few years increased both its mass of active users and committers,
and the communication in the project has risen accordingly. This project
model will serve to reduce this overhead by providing an up-to-date
description of the project.

During the Core elections in 2002, Mark Murray stated “I am opposed to a
long rule-book, as that satisfies lawyer-tendencies, and is counter to
the technocentricity that the project so badly needs.” [`FreeBSD,
2002B <bibliography.html#bsd-election2002>`__]. This project model is
not meant to be a tool to justify creating impositions for developers,
but as a tool to facilitate coordination. It is meant as a description
of the project, with an overview of how the different processes are
executed. It is an introduction to how the FreeBSD project works.

The FreeBSD project model will be described as of July 1st, 2004. It is
based on the Niels J?rgensen's paper [`J?rgensen,
2001 <bibliography.html#jorgensen2001>`__], FreeBSD's official
documents, discussions on FreeBSD mailing lists and interviews with
developers.

After providing definitions of terms used, this document will outline
the organisational structure (including role descriptions and
communication lines), discuss the methodology model and after presenting
the tools used for process control, it will present the defined
processes. Finally it will outline major sub-projects of the FreeBSD
project.

[`FreeBSD, 2002A <bibliography.html#freebsd-developer-handbook>`__,
Section 1.2 and 1.3] give the vision and the architectural guidelines
for the project. The vision is “To produce the best UNIX-like operating
system package possible, with due respect to the original software tools
ideology as well as usability, performance and stability.” The
architectural guidelines help determine whether a problem that someone
wants to be solved is within the scope of the project
