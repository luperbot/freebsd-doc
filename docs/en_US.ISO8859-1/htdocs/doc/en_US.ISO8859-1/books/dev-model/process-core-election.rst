6.3.?Core election
------------------

Core elections are held at least every two years.
`:sup:`[8]` <#ftn.idp64286416>`__ Nine core members are elected. New
elections are held if the number of core members drops below seven. New
elections can also be held should at least 1/3 of the active committers
demand this.

When an election is to take place, core announces this at least 6 weeks
in advance, and appoints an election manager to run the elections.

Only committers can be elected into core. The candidates need to submit
their candidacy at least one week before the election starts, but can
refine their statements until the voting starts. They are presented in
the `candidates
list <http://election.uk.freebsd.org/candidates.html>`__. When writing
their election statements, the candidates must answer a few standard
questions submitted by the election manager.

During elections, the rule that a committer must have committed during
the 12 past months is followed strictly. Only these committers are
eligible to vote.

When voting, the committer may vote once in support of up to nine
nominees. The voting is done over a period of four weeks with reminders
being posted on “developers” mailing list that is available to all
committers.

The election results are released one week after the election ends, and
the new core team takes office one week after the results have been
posted.

Should there be a voting tie, this will be resolved by the new,
unambiguously elected core members.

Votes and candidate statements are archived, but the archives are not
publicly available.

Core announces the election and selects an election manager. He prepares
the elections, and when ready, candidates can announce their candidacies
through submitting their statements. The committers then vote. After the
vote is over, the election results are announced and the new core team
takes office.

Hats in core elections are:
