No license can guarantee future software availability. Although a
copyright holder can traditionally change the terms of a copyright at
anytime, the presumption in the BSD community is that such an attempt
simply causes the source to fork.

The GPL explicitly disallows revoking the license. It has occurred,
however, that a company (Mattel) purchased a GPL copyright (cphack),
revoked the entire copyright, went to court, and prevailed [2]. That is,
they legally revoked the entire distribution and all derivative works
based on the copyright. Whether this could happen with a larger and more
dispersed distribution is an open question; there is also some confusion
regarding whether the software was really under the GPL.

In another example, Red Hat purchased Cygnus, an engineering company
that had taken over development of the FSF compiler tools. Cygnus was
able to do so because they had developed a business model in which they
sold support for GNU software. This enabled them to employ some 50
engineers and drive the direction of the programs by contributing the
preponderance of modifications. As Donald Rosenberg states "projects
using licenses like the GPL...live under constant threat of having
someone take over the project by producing a better version of the code
and doing it faster than the original owners." [3]
