Long before the term “Open Source” was used, software was developed by
loose associations of programmers and freely exchanged. Starting in the
early 1950's, organizations such as `SHARE <http://www.share.org>`__ and
`DECUS <http://www.decus.org>`__ developed much of the software that
computer hardware companies bundled with their hardware offerings. At
that time computer companies were in the hardware business; anything
that reduced software cost and made more programs available made the
hardware companies more competitive.

This model changed in the 1960's. In 1965 ADR developed the first
licensed software product independent of a hardware company. ADR was
competing against a free IBM package originally developed by IBM
customers. ADR patented their software in 1968. To stop sharing of their
program, they provided it under an equipment lease in which payment was
spread over the lifetime of the product. ADR thus retained ownership and
could control resale and reuse.

In 1969 the US Department of Justice charged IBM with destroying
businesses by bundling free software with IBM hardware. As a result of
this suit, IBM unbundled its software; that is, software became
independent products separate from hardware.

In 1968 Informatics introduced the first commercial killer-app and
rapidly established the concept of the software product, the software
company, and very high rates of return. Informatics developed the
perpetual license which is now standard throughout the computer
industry, wherein ownership is never transferred to the customer.
