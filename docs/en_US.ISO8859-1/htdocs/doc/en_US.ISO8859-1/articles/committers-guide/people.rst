Besides the repository meisters, there are other FreeBSD project members
and teams whom you will probably get to know in your role as a
committer. Briefly, and by no means all-inclusively, these are:

   <div class="variablelist">

Documentation Engineering Team ``<doceng@FreeBSD.org>``
    doceng is the group responsible for the documentation build
    infrastructure, approving new documentation committers, and ensuring
    that the FreeBSD website and documentation on the FTP site is up to
    date with respect to the subversion tree. It is not a conflict
    resolution body. The vast majority of documentation related
    discussion takes place on the `FreeBSD documentation project mailing
    list <http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-doc>`__.
    More details regarding the doceng team can be found in its
    `charter <http://www.FreeBSD.org/internal/doceng.html>`__.
    Committers interested in contributing to the documentation should
    familiarize themselves with the `Documentation Project
    Primer <../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/index.html>`__.

Bruce Evans ``<bde@FreeBSD.org>``
    Bruce is the Style Police-Meister. When you do a commit that could
    have been done better, Bruce will be there to tell you. Be thankful
    that someone is. Bruce is also very knowledgeable on the various
    standards applicable to FreeBSD.

Glen Barber ``<gjb@FreeBSD.org>``, Konstantin Belousov
``<kib@FreeBSD.org>``, Marc Fonvieille ``<blackend@FreeBSD.org>``, Xin
Li ``<delphij@FreeBSD.org>``, Craig Rodrigues ``<rodrigc@FreeBSD.org>``,
Hiroki Sato ``<hrs@FreeBSD.org>``, Gleb Smirnoff
``<glebius@FreeBSD.org>``, Marius Strobl ``<marius@FreeBSD.org>``,
Robert Watson ``<rwatson@FreeBSD.org>``
    These are the members of the Release Engineering Team
    ``<re@FreeBSD.org>``. This team is responsible for setting release
    deadlines and controlling the release process. During code freezes,
    the release engineers have final authority on all changes to the
    system for whichever branch is pending release status. If there is
    something you want merged from FreeBSD-CURRENT to FreeBSD-STABLE
    (whatever values those may have at any given time), these are the
    people to talk to about it.

    Hiroki is also the keeper of the release documentation
    (``src/release/doc/*``). If you commit a change that you think is
    worthy of mention in the release notes, please make sure he knows
    about it. Better still, send him a patch with your suggested
    commentary.

Dag-Erling C. Sm?rgrav ``<des@FreeBSD.org>``
    Dag-Erling is the `FreeBSD Security
    Officer <../../../../security/>`__ and oversees the Security Officer
    Team ``<security-officer@FreeBSD.org>``.

Garrett Wollman ``<wollman@FreeBSD.org>``
    If you need advice on obscure network internals or are not sure of
    some potential change to the networking subsystem you have in mind,
    Garrett is someone to talk to. Garrett is also very knowledgeable on
    the various standards applicable to FreeBSD.

FreeBSD committer's mailing list
    `svn-src-all <http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/svn-src-all>`__,
    `svn-ports-all <http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/svn-ports-all>`__
    and
    `svn-doc-all <http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/svn-doc-all>`__
    are the mailing lists that the version control system uses to send
    commit messages to. You should *never* send email directly to these
    lists. You should only send replies to this list when they are short
    and are directly related to a commit.

FreeBSD developers mailing list
    All committers are subscribed to -developers. This list was created
    to be a forum for the committers “community” issues. Examples are
    Core voting, announcements, etc.

    The FreeBSD developers mailing list is for the exclusive use of
    FreeBSD committers. In order to develop FreeBSD, committers must
    have the ability to openly discuss matters that will be resolved
    before they are publicly announced. Frank discussions of work in
    progress are not suitable for open publication and may harm FreeBSD.

    All FreeBSD committers are expected not to not publish or forward
    messages from the FreeBSD developers mailing list outside the list
    membership without permission of all of the authors. Violators will
    be removed from the FreeBSD developers mailing list, resulting in a
    suspension of commit privileges. Repeated or flagrant violations may
    result in permanent revocation of commit privileges.

    This list is *not* intended as a place for code reviews or for any
    technical discussion. In fact using it as such hurts the FreeBSD
    Project as it gives a sense of a closed list where general decisions
    affecting all of the FreeBSD using community are made without being
    “open”. Last, but not least *never, never ever, email the FreeBSD
    developers mailing list and CC:/BCC: another FreeBSD list*. Never,
    ever email another FreeBSD email list and CC:/BCC: the FreeBSD
    developers mailing list. Doing so can greatly diminish the benefits
    of this list.
