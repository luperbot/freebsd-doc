Various software or data exist in the repositories where the FreeBSD
project has been granted a special licence to be able to use them. A
case in point are the Terminus fonts for use with
`vt(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vt&sektion=4>`__. Here
the author Dimitar Zhekov has allowed us to use the "Terminus BSD
Console" font under a 2-clause BSD license rather than the regular Open
Font License he normally uses.

It is clearly sensible to keep a record of any such license grants. To
that end, the Core Team ``<core@FreeBSD.org>`` has decided to keep an
archive of them. Whenever the FreeBSD project is granted a special
license we require the Core Team ``<core@FreeBSD.org>`` to be notified.
Any developers involved in arranging such a license grant, please send
details to the Core Team ``<core@FreeBSD.org>`` including:

   <div class="itemizedlist">

-  Contact details for people or organizations granting the special
   license.

-  What files, directories etc. in the repositories are covered by the
   license grant including the revision numbers where any specially
   licensed material was committed.

-  The date the license comes into effect from. Unless otherwise agreed,
   this will be the date the license was issued by the authors of the
   software in question.

-  The license text.

-  A note of any restrictions, limitations or exceptions that apply
   specifically to FreeBSD's usage of the licensed material.

-  Any other relevant information.

Once the Core Team ``<core@FreeBSD.org>`` is satisfied that all the
necessary details have been gathered and are correct, the secretary will
send a PGP-signed acknowledgement of receipt including the license
details. This receipt will be persistently archived and serve as our
permanent record of the license grant.

The license archive should contain only details of license grants; this
is not the place for any discussions around licensing or other subjects.
Access to data within the license archive will be available on request
to the Core Team ``<core@FreeBSD.org>``.
