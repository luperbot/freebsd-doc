FreeBSD News Flash! (1998)
==========================

December 1998
-------------

-  **28-Dec-98** Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, FreeBSD 3.0
   will depart the -CURRENT branch late in the day on 15 January 1999.
   The 3.1 release will follow 30 days later, on 15 February 1999.
   Developers should consider this as ADVANCE NOTICE of these events.

-  **13-Dec-98** Walnut Creek CDROM has opened the `FreeBSD
   Mall <http://www.freebsdmall.com/>`__, a site devoted to the
   commercial aspects of FreeBSD, including add-ons, hardware, and
   commercial tech-support. To advertise or sell your products or
   services at the FreeBSD Mall, contact BSDi.

November 1998
-------------

-  **30-Nov-98** `FreeBSD 2.2.8 <../../releases/2.2.8R/announce.html>`__
   has been released. Please see the `Release
   Information <../../releases/index.html>`__ page for more details.
   Also be sure to check the `release
   errata <../../releases/2.2.8R/errata.html>`__ after installation for
   any late-breaking issues with 2.2.8 that you might need to be aware
   of.

-  **26-Nov-98** `FreeBSD Rocks <http://www.freebsdrocks.com/>`__ is an
   initiative designed to provide the FreeBSD community with the latest
   FreeBSD news, software and resources. All areas include search
   facilities, making keyword searching of historical posts a breeze.
   The pages are updated daily and everyone is invited to sign up an
   post an article. If it happened today, you'll see it on FreeBSDRocks.

October 1998
------------

-  **15-Oct-98** `FreeBSD 3.0 <../../releases/3.0R/announce.html>`__ has
   been released. See the `Release
   Information <../../releases/index.html>`__ page for details. Also be
   sure to check the `release
   errata <../../releases/3.0R/errata.html>`__ after installation for
   any late-breaking issues with 3.0 that you might need to be aware of.

September 1998
--------------

-  **15-Sep-98** September 15th is the scheduled date for entering BETA
   with the 3.0-CURRENT tree. As all of you already (should) know, 3.0
   is scheduled for release on October 15th so this gives us a nice 30
   day BETA period. During this time, I don't expect anyone to drop in
   significant new work or otherwise perturb the 3.0-CURRENT tree in
   such a way that violates the general idea of a BETA (you're supposed
   to test what you have, not move the goalposts every couple of days
   :).

-  **13-Sep-98** After more than a year of development, the Common
   Access Method SCSI layer for FreeBSD will be integrated into
   3.0-CURRENT on Sunday, September 13th. The CAM development team is
   currently busy ensuring that the integration process goes as smoothly
   as possible, so please understand that we may be slow to respond to
   questions about CAM during that time.

-  **09-Sep-98** Perl5 is now imported into the 3.0-CURRENT source tree.

-  **05-Sep-98** `The BSD CD Giveaway
   List <http://visar.csustan.edu/>`__. If somebody has a CD to give
   away (recipient pays for shipping) or to lend locally, they can put
   their email address on the list. Hardware and literature can also be
   given away. We encourage people to donate CDs to local libraries and
   put them on the list as well.

-  **01-Sep-98** First issue of Daemon News arrives day earlier. This
   ezine is by the BSD community for the BSD community. See
   http://www.daemonnews.org/

August 1998
-----------

-  **31-Aug-98** FreeBSD -CURRENT branch (the future 3.0-RELEASE) has
   switched to ELF from a.out format. People involved did a great job;
   transition went smooth. Check the
   `freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org <http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html>`__
   mail archive for more information on the transition to ELF.

-  **23-Aug-98** Suidcontrol-0.1 utility has been released. The
   suidcontrol is an experimental utility for managing suid/sgid policy
   under FreeBSD. You can get more information at
   http://www.watson.org/fbsd-hardening/suidcontrol.html

-  **09-Aug-98** FreeBSD Security How-To has been published. This work
   is currently in beta and can be found at
   http://www.best.com/~jkb/howto.txt

July 1998
---------

-  **22-Jul-98** FreeBSD 2.2.7 has been released. See the `Release
   Information <../../releases/index.html>`__ page for details. Also be
   sure to check the `release
   errata <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.2.7-RELEASE/ERRATA.TXT>`__
   after installation for any late-breaking issues with 2.2.7 that you
   should know about.

-  **16-Jul-98** A \`\`FreeBSD for Linux users'' documentation effort
   has started. Please see the `list of current documentation
   projects <../../docproj/current.html>`__ for more information.

-  **13-Jul-98** `Jordan Hubbard <mailto:jkh@FreeBSD.org>`__ writes an
   `editorial <http://editorials.freshmeat.net/jordan980713/>`__ on the
   past and future of the Unix community.

-  **09-Jul-98** A `Spanish
   translation <http://www.es.FreeBSD.org/es/FAQ/FAQ.html>`__ of the
   `FAQ <../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/index.html>`__ has been
   completed by the `Spanish Documentation
   Project <http://www.es.FreeBSD.org/es/>`__. More information can be
   found at the `translations page <../../docproj/translations.html>`__.

May 1998
--------

-  **30-May-98** FreeBSD and Apache are used in `this very useful
   article <http://www.WebTechniques.com/features/1998/05/engelschall/engelschall.shtml>`__
   on implementing a web farm using round-robin DNS in
   `WEBTechniques.com <http://www.WebTechniques.com/>`__.

-  **23-May-98** The second issue of the FreeBSD Newsletter is now
   available in `Adobe PDF
   format <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/newsletter/issue2.pdf>`__

   A `help
   file <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/newsletter/README.TXT>`__
   is available to assist you in selecting and using a PDF viewer.
   Article submissions, advertisements, and letters to the editor should
   be sent to newsletter@FreeBSD.org.

-  **01-May-98** The FreeBSD Project set up `Anonymous
   CVS <../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/synching.html#ANONCVS>`__
   for the `FreeBSD CVS tree <http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/>`__. Among
   other things, it allows users of FreeBSD to perform, with no special
   privileges, read-only CVS operations against one of the FreeBSD
   project's official anoncvs servers.

April 1998
----------

-  **16-Apr-98** The new 4 CD set of FreeBSD 2.2.6 is now in stock and
   should start shipping to subscription and back-order customers
   tomorrow. More information on the CD contents are available from
   http://www.wccdrom.com/.

-  **11-Apr-98** The new FreeBSD project FreeBSD Mozilla Group is
