   | While finished thin servers should be optimized in both hardware
     and software for the task at hand, who says the software and
     hardware must come from the same developer? This Perspective
     examines the emerging trend in the OEM market of divorcing the
     software layer from the hardware layer. Many operating systems are
     vying to be the OS of choice for thin servers. This document
     examines this issue in detail, particularly the differences between
     Linux and FreeBSD, the current de facto leaders in the market.
