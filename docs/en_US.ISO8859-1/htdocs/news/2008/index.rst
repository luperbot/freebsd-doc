-  | \ **3 June, 2008:** The FreeBSD Project has begun the switch of its
     source code management system from CVS to
     `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`__. At this point in
     time, FreeBSD's developers are making changes to the base system in
     the Subversion repository. We have a replication system in place
     that exports our work to the legacy CVS tree on a continuous basis.
   | People who are using our extensive CVS based distribution network
     (including anoncvs, CVSup, cvsweb, ftp) will not be interrupted by
     our work-in-progress. We are committed to maintaining the existing
     CVS based distribution system for at least the support lifetime of
     all existing "stable" branches. Security and errata patches will
     continue to be made available in their usual CVS locations.
   | We expect to make our Subversion based source tree and other
     supporting infrastructure public soon. There will be new mailing
     lists to subscribe to if you wish to receive Subversion commit
     notifications.
   | Our ports, doc and www trees are not affected at this time. A
     separate decision will be made regarding those CVS repositories
     soon.
   | Many people have contributed to the effort, but we wish to thank
     Michael Haggerty and the `cvs2svn <http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/>`__
     project developers for their assistance with cvs2svn. `Peter
     Wemm <mailto:peter@FreeBSD.org>`__ spent several weeks of
     `Yahoo!'s <http://www.yahoo.com/>`__ time repairing the CVS tree,
     preparing for and performing the conversion, and the configuration
     of the Subversion infrastructure. Yahoo! donated the server
     hardware.

==========

-  | \ **22 April, 2008:** The FreeBSD Project received over 100
     applications for `Google's Summer of
     Code <http://code.google.com/soc>`__ program, amongst which 21 were
     selected for funding. Unfortunately, there were far more first rate
     applications than available spots for students. However, we
     encourage students to work together with us all year round. The
     FreeBSD Project is always willing to help mentor students learn
     more about operating system development through our normal
     community mailing lists and development forums. Contributing to an
     open source software project is a valuable component of a computer
     science education and great preparation for a career in software
     development.
   | A complete list of the winning students and projects is available
     `here <http://www.freebsd.org/projects/summerofcode-2008.html>`__.
     A `Summer of Code
     wiki <http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCode2008>`__ has been created
     and additional information about the projects will be added there
     soon.

-  \ **31 March, 2008:** The deadline for student applications to
   participate in the `Google Summer of
   Code <http://code.google.com/soc>`__ has been extended by one week.
   The new deadline is Monday, April 7, 2008. If you haven't already,
   please visit our `FreeBSD Summer of Code
   page <http://www.FreeBSD.org/projects/summerofcode.html>`__ and look
   at the example project ideas we've listed there, or propose your own.
   There are many new ideas listed since the first announcements went
   out.

-  \ **26 March, 2008:** The student application period for the Google
   `Summer of Code 2008 <http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html>`__
   program has begun. Please peruse our list of FreeBSD specific
   `projects and potential mentors <../../projects/summerofcode.html>`__
   and prepare your application before the March 31 deadline. Earlier
   applications are encouraged as this provides an opportunity for
   potential mentors to work on improving the applications with students
   before the deadline.

-  | \ **17 March, 2008:** The FreeBSD Project will soon be accepting
     applications for the Google `Summer of Code
     2008 <http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html>`__ program. This
     program will provide funding for students to spend the summer
     contributing to open source software projects. A list of FreeBSD
     specific projects and potential mentors is available
     `here <../../projects/summerofcode.html>`__.
   | Once a suitable project and mentor have been identified, interested
     students should complete a proposal and submit it to Google. The
     application period begins on March 24, 2008 and the final deadline
     is April 1, 2008 0:00 UTC. Please see the `Google
     FAQ <http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html>`__ for
     more information.
