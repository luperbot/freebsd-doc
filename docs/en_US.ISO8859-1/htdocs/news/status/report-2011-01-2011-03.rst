--------------

Bringing up OMAP3
-----------------

| Contact: Warner Losh <imp@bsdimp.com\ >
|  Contact: Mohammed Farrag <mfarrag@FreeBSD.org\ >

OMAP3 Emulation:

-  Step #1: qemu-omap3 isn't ported to FreeBSD yet. So,
-  Step #2: Use qemu-omap3 on Gentoo Host ..
-  Step #3: Is the end reached ?! No, bcz qemu-omap3 is not full. So, go
   to step #4.
-  Step #4: Use Meego >> Download Ubuntu 10.10 >> Install it, and
-  Step #5: Compile FreeBSD kernel, Create root file system, mkimage,
   Emulate using Meego.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Device Drivers for OMAP3 Processors.

--------------

GEOM-based ataraid(4) Replacement — geom\_raid.
-----------------------------------------------

| Contact: Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: M. Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org\ >

A new RAID GEOM class (geom\_raid) was added to FreeBSD 9-CURRENT, to
replace ataraid(4) in supporting various BIOS-based software RAIDs.
Unlike ataraid(4) this implementation does not depend on legacy ata(4)
subsystem and can be used with any disk drivers, including new CAM-based
ones (ahci(4), siis(4), mvs(4) and ata(4) with \`options ATA\_CAM\`). To
make code more readable and extensible, this implementation follows
modular design, including a core part and two sets of modules,
implementing support for different metadata formats and RAID levels.

Support for such popular metadata formats is now implemented: Intel,
JMicron, NVIDIA, Promise (also used by AMD/ATI) and SiliconImage.

Such RAID levels are now supported: RAID0, RAID1, RAID1E, RAID10,
SINGLE, CONCAT.

For any all of these RAID levels and metadata formats this class
supports full cycle of volume operations: reading, writing, creation,
deletion, disk removal and insertion, rebuilding, dirty shutdown
detection and resynchronization, bad sector recovery, faulty disks
tracking, hot-spare disks. For Intel and Promise formats there is
support for multiple volumes per disk set.

See the graid(8) manual page for additional details.

Sponsored by: Cisco Systems, Inc. and iXsystems, Inc.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Implement metadata modules for other formats (DDF, Highpoint, VIA,
   ...).
#. Implement transformation modules for other RAID levels (RAID5, ...).

--------------

HAST (Highly Available Storage)
-------------------------------

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org\ >

Contact: Mikolaj Golub <trociny@FreeBSD.org\ >

HAST development is progressing nicely. Mikolaj Golub who contributes to
HAST is now a FreeBSD src committer. Some changes worth noting since the
last report:

-  Compression of the data being sent over the network. This can speed
   up especially synchronization process.
-  Optional checksuming for the data being send over the network.
-  Capsicum sandboxing for secondary node and hastctl.
-  Chroot+setuid+setgid sandboxing for primary node.
-  Allow administrators to specify source IP address for connections.
-  When changing role wait for a while for the other node to switch from
   primary to secondary to avoid split-brain.
-  Many bug fixes.

--------------

New FreeBSD Installer
---------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/BSDInstall
|  URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/PCBSDInstallMerge

Contact: Nathan Whitehorn <nwhitehorn@FreeBSD.org\ >

On March 14th, sysinstall was replaced on the 9.0 snapshot media by a
new, modular installer called BSDInstall. This adds support for a wide
variety of new features while simplifying the installation process.
Testing before the 9.0 release will be very much appreciated -- CD and
memory stick images for a variety of platforms are linked from the
BSDInstall wiki page.

Interesting features:

-  Install CD media are always live CDs
-  Installations spanning multiple disks
-  Wireless setup
-  GPT disk formatting
-  Virtualization friendly: can install from a live system onto disk
   images
-  Easily hackable and more modular than sysinstall
-  Greater flexibility: shells available throughout the installation

Work is presently ongoing to integrate this installer with the backend
provided by pc-sysinstall (second wiki link).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. ZFS installation support.
#. IA64 disk setup.

--------------

OpenAFS Port
------------

| URL: http://openafs.org
|  URL: http://web.mit.edu/freebsd/openafs/openafs.shar

| Contact: Benjamin Kaduk <kaduk@mit.edu\ >
|  Contact: Derrick Brashear <shadow@gmail.com\ >

AFS is a distributed network filesystem that originated from the Andrew
Project at Carnegie-Mellon University. The OpenAFS client implementation
has not been particularly useful on FreeBSD since the FreeBSD 4.X
releases. Work covered in previous reports brought the OpenAFS client to
a useful form on 9.0-CURRENT, though with some rough edges. Since our
last report, we have fixed several bugs that were impacting usability,
and we expect the upcoming 1.6.0 release to be usable for regular client
workloads (though not heavy load). Accordingly, we have submitted
packaging for inclusion in the Ports Collection (PR ports/152467).

There are several known outstanding issues that are being worked on, but
detailed bug reports are welcome at port-freebsd@openafs.org.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Update VFS locking to allow the use of disk-based client caches as
   well as memory-based caches.
#. Track down races and deadlocks that may appear under load.
#. Integrate with the bsd.kmod.mk kernel-module build infrastructure.
#. Eliminate a moderate memory leak from the kernel module.
#. PAG (Process Authentication Group) support is not functional.

--------------

pfSense

| Contact: Scott Ullrich <sullrich@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Chris Buechler <cmb@pfsense.org\ >
|  Contact: Ermal Luci <eri@FreeBSD.org\ >

Work on 2.0 is rapidly coming to an end. We released RC1 around Feb 25
2011 and so far it seems to be rather stable. 2.0 is our first major
release in 2 years and almost all limitations of the previous version
has been overcome.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Finish testing RC1 and certify for release.

--------------

RCTL, aka Resource Containers
-----------------------------

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org\ >

Most of the code has already been merged into CURRENT. There are two
remaining problems I would like to solve before 9.0-RELEASE - see below
- but otherwise, the code is stable; please test and report any
problems. You will need to rebuild the kernel with "options RACCT" and
"options RCTL". The rctl(8) manual page should be a good introduction on
how to use it.

This project was sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Reimplementing %CPU accounting and CPU throttling.
#. Making jail rules persistent - right now, one cannot add jail rule
   before that jail is created, which makes it impossible to put them
   into /etc/rctl.conf; also, rules disappear when jail gets destroyed.

--------------

ZFSv28 available in FreeBSD 9-CURRENT
-------------------------------------

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org\ >

Contact: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org\ >

ZFS v28 is now in HEAD! Test, test, test and test. Pretty please. New
features include:

-  Data deduplication.
-  Triple parity RAIDZ (RAIDZ3).
-  zfs diff.
-  zpool split.
-  Snapshot holds.
-  zpool import -F. Allows to rewind corrupted pool to earlier
   transaction group.
-  Possibility to import pool in read-only mode.

FreeBSD Bugbusting Team
-----------------------

|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/studies/prs/

| Contact: Gavin Atkinson <gavin@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Remko Lodder <remko@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Volker Werth <vwe@FreeBSD.org\ >

The bugmeister team is happy to welcome Eitan Adler (eadler@) as the
newest GNATS-only contributor. Eitan has been helping triage new bugs as
they come in, as well as making good progress on many of the older bugs,
closing duplicates and obsolete bugs and contacting submitters for extra
information where necessary. For the first time in a long time we
managed to get below 6000 open PRs, in no small part due to Eitan's
efforts. Welcome aboard!

PRs continue to be classified as they arrive, by adding 'tags' to the
subject lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem involved, or man
page references for userland PRs. Reports are generated from these
nightly, grouping related PRs into one place, sorted by tag or man page.
This allows an interested party working in one area or on one subsystem
to easily find related bugs and issues in the same area, which has
proven quite effective in getting some of the older bug reports closed.
These reports can all be found by following the third link above.

We continue to look for ideas for other reports that may help improve
the PR closure rate. If you have any suggestions for reports which would
contribute positively to the way you work, please email bugmeister@ and
we shall try to produce such a report.

Our clearance rate of PRs, especially in kern and bin, seems to be
improving. The number of non-ports PRs has stayed almost constant since
the last status report.

As always, anybody interested in helping out with the PR queue is
welcome to join us in #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet. We are always
looking for additional help, whether your interests lie in triaging
incoming PRs, generating patches to resolve existing problems, or simply
helping with the database housekeeping (identifying duplicate PRs, ones
that have already been resolved, etc). This is a great way of getting
more involved with FreeBSD!

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs
   that the team has already analyzed.

--------------

FreeBSD NYI Admins Status Report
--------------------------------

Contact: NYI Admins Team <nyi-admin@FreeBSD.org\ >

The FreeBSD.org site at New York Internet is progressing, though more
slowly than we had hoped. Due to problems with the old power controllers
and serial console servers, new equipment has been bought by the FreeBSD
Foundation. Installing the new equipment required re-racking all the
existing servers which was done by the local FreeBSD team (Steven
Kreuzer and John Baldwin).

For basic infrastructure at the site (such as DHCP, DNS, console etc.)
the FreeBSD Foundation bought some new servers which are in the process
of being configured.

The FreeBSD Ports team are currently using 9 of the NYI servers for
package building.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. We are looking for a storage system (15TB+) for keeping replicas of
   all the main FreeBSD.org systems, a full ftp-archive mirror, site
   local files etc.

The FreeBSD Foundation Status Report
------------------------------------

URL: http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org\ >

We created our `2011
budget <http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/documents/Budget2011.pdf>`__.
Some of our plans for 2011 include spending $125,000 on project
development and $75,000 on equipment to build up FreeBSD facilities in
three locations.

We were proud to be a sponsor for AsiaBSDCon 2011 in Tokyo. We also
committed to sponsoring BSDCan 2011 in May, and EuroBSDCon 2011 in
October. The Foundation was also represented at SCALE in Los Angeles,
Indiana LinuxFest in Indianapolis, and Flourish in Chicago.

Completed Foundation-funded projects: `Five New TCP Congestion Control
Algorithms
project <http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/announcements.shtml#Swinburne>`__
by Swinburne University and Resource Containers project by Edward
Napierala.

In February we visited companies in the Bay Area that use FreeBSD. Our
goal was to promote FreeBSD, better understand their interests and
needs, and help facilitate stronger relationships between these
companies and the Project. The presentations we gave included the
benefits of FreeBSD, Project road-map, potential areas of collaboration,
case studies, and how the Foundation supports the project. By visiting
in person we were able to show our commitment to the Project and respond
directly to questions and concerns they may have had. We were pleased
with the positive responses we received and plan on visiting more
companies in the future.

We are funding two new projects. The first project is Implementing
Support of GEM, KMS, and DRI for Intel Drivers by Konstantin Belousov.
The second is Improving the Maturity of IPv6 Support of FreeBSD and
PC-BSD by Bjoern Zeeb.

We continued our work on infrastructure projects to beef up hardware for
package-building, network-testing, etc. This includes purchasing
equipment as well as managing equipment donations.

Stop by and visit with us at BSDCan (May 13-14) and SouthEast LinuxFest
(June 10-12).

The work above as well as many other tasks we do for the project,
couldn't be done without donations. Please help us by making a donation
or asking your company to make a donation. We would be happy to send
marketing literature to you or your company. Find out how to make a
donation at http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/.

DIstributed Firewall and Flow-shaper Using Statistical Evidence (DIFFUSE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/
|  URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/downloads.html

| Contact: Sebastian Zander <szander@swin.edu.au\ >
|  Contact: Grenville Armitage <garmitage@swin.edu.au\ >

DIFFUSE is a system enabling FreeBSD's IPFW firewall subsystem to
classify IP traffic based on statistical traffic properties.

With DIFFUSE, IPFW computes statistics (such as packet lengths or
inter-packet time intervals) for observed flows, and uses ML (machine
learning) to classify flows into classes. In addition to traditional
packet inspection rules, IPFW rules may now also be expressed in terms
of traffic statistics or classes identified by ML classification. This
can be helpful when direct packet inspection is problematic (perhaps for
administrative reasons, or because port numbers do not reliably identify
applications).

DIFFUSE also enables one instance of IPFW to send flow information and
classes to other IPFW instances, which then can act on such traffic
(e.g. prioritise, accept, deny, etc.) according to its class. This
allows for distributed architectures, where classification at one
location in your network is used to control fire-walling or rate-shaping
actions at other locations.

DIFFUSE is a set of patches for FreeBSD-CURRENT. It can be downloaded
from the project's web site. The web site also contains a more
comprehensive introduction, including application examples, links to
related work and documentation.

In February 2011 we released DIFFUSE v0.2.2. This release contains a
number of bug fixes and new features. Most notably since version 0.2
there is a tool to build classifier models, and there is a feature
module and classifier model to classify Skype traffic.

We hope to release DIFFUSE v0.3 soon. Keep an eye on the freebsd-ipfw
and freebsd-net mailing lists for project-related announcements.

|  Contact: Grenville Armitage <garmitage@swin.edu.au\ >
|  Contact: Rui Paulo <rpaulo@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Bjoern Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org\ >

The project is now complete, with the following code available in the
svn head branch:

-  Modular congestion control framework.
-  Khelp (Kernel Helper) and Hhook (Helper Hook) frameworks.
-  Basic Khelp/Hhook integration with the TCP stack.
-  Enhanced Round Trip Time (ERTT) Khelp module.
-  Modularised implementations of NewReno, CUBIC, H-TCP, Vegas,
   Hamilton-Delay and CAIA-Hamilton-Delay congestion control algorithms.

In addition to the code, a large set of documentation was committed (see
the following man pages: cc(4), cc\_newreno(4), cc\_cubic(4),
cc\_htcp(4), cc\_vegas(4), cc\_hd(4), cc\_chd(4), h\_ertt(4), cc(9),
khelp(9), hhook(9)) and a `technical
report <http://caia.swin.edu.au/reports/110228A/CAIA-TR-110228A.pdf>`__
was released which evaluates the computational overhead associated with
TCP before and after the project's changes.

A candidate patch to MFC the modular congestion control framework to the
8-STABLE branch is ready for testing
`here <http://people.FreeBSD.org/~lstewart/patches/5cc/modularcc_mfc_8.x.r219091.patch>`__.
If you try the patch, please send a note detailing your experience
(positive or negative) to Lawrence Stewart.

Thanks go to the FreeBSD Foundation for funding this work, to the
project's technical reviewers for providing detailed feedback, and to
all FreeBSD users who have provided testing feedback thus far.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Test `8-STABLE MFC candidate
   patch <http://people.FreeBSD.org/~lstewart/patches/5cc/modularcc_mfc_8.x.r219091.patch>`__
   and do the merge in time for 8.3-RELEASE.

Journaled Soft Updates
----------------------

| Contact: Jeff Roberson <jeff@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Kirk McKusick <mckusick@mckusick.com\ >

All known problems with journaled soft updates have been fixed in head.
If you have any problems while running with journaled soft updates,
please report them to us.

We have addressed several performance issues that have been brought to
our attention. If you have any performance problems while running with
journaled soft updates, please report them to us.

We have improved the recovery of resources when running with soft
updates on small (root) filesystems. We anticipate being able to use
soft updates for root filesystems in the 9.0 system.

We expect to have journaled soft updates default to enabled in the 9.0
system. We encourage users of -CURRENT to enable journaled soft updates
to help shake out any remaining performance problems and bugs.

Linux Compatibility Layer - DVB and V4L2 Support
------------------------------------------------

URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~nox/dvb/

Contact: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org\ >

Following (separate) discussions on the mailing lists I have made
patches to add DVB and V4L2 ioctl translation support to the Linux
compatibility layer, allowing Linux apps like SageTV, Skype, and Flash
to use DVB/ATSC tuners and webcams that previously only worked for
native FreeBSD apps. (Most of this hardware uses Linux drivers via the
`multimedia/webcamd <http://www.freshports.org/multimedia/webcamd>`__
port.)

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Handle the remaining ioctls that (I think) are not used by DVB
   tuners/cameras supported by webcamd (it only supports USB devices,
   the unhandled ioctls mostly have to do with video overlays and

New FreeBSD Handbook Section Covering HAST
------------------------------------------

URL:
http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/disks-hast.html

Contact: Daniel Gerzo <danger@FreeBSD.org\ >

A new FreeBSD Handbook section covering the Highly Available STorage, or
HAST developed by Pawel Jakub Dawidek has been recently added. In this
section, you will learn what HAST is, how it works, which features it
provides and how to set it up. It also includes a working example on how
it can be used together with devd(8) and CARP. Enjoy your reading.

The FreeBSD German Documentation Project Status Report
------------------------------------------------------

URL: http://doc.bsdgroup.de

| Contact: Johann Kois <jkois@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org\ >

Benedict Reuschling contributed the translation of the new handbook
section about HAST, while Benjamin Lukas was working on the first
translation of the firewall chapter of the handbook. The committers to
the German Documentation Project were busy with keeping the existing
German documentation up-to-date. The website translations were also kept
in sync with the ones on FreeBSD.org.

We tried to re-activate committers who did not contribute for some time
but most of them are currently unable to free up enough time. We hope to
gain fresh contributor blood as we are getting occasional reports about
bugs and grammar in the german translation.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Submit grammar, spelling or other errors you find in the german
   documents and the website.
#. Translate more articles and other open handbook sections.

| Contact: Hiroki Sato <hrs@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Ryusuke Suzuki <ryusuke@FreeBSD.org\ >

The www/ja and doc/ja\_JP.eucJP/books/handbook have constantly been
updated. During this period, translation of the handbook installation
page was finished. The following chapters are now synchronized with the
English version:

-  introduction
-  install
-  ports
-  x11
-  desktop
-  multimedia
-  mirrors
-  pgpkeys

Merging translation results from the www tree on a separate repository
for the translation work into the main tree was also finished. Since
outdated and/or non-translated documents also remain in both
doc/ja\_JP.eucJP and www, further translation work is still needed. Some
progress has been made in the Porter's Handbook as well in this period.

FreeBSD/EC2
-----------

URL: http://www.daemonology.net/freebsd-on-ec2/

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org\ >

FreeBSD is now able to run on t1.micro and cc1.4xlarge instances in the
Amazon EC2 cloud. FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE is stable subject to the
limitations of the instance type (e.g., running ZFS on a micro instance
with only 600 MB of RAM doesn't work very well), but FreeBSD 9.0 has
significant stability issues.

A list of available FreeBSD AMIs (EC2 machine images) appears on the
FreeBSD/EC2 status page.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Bring FreeBSD to a wider range of EC2 instance types.
#. Completely rework the locking in head/sys/i386/xen/pmap.c to
   eliminate races and make 9.0-CURRENT stable under paravirtualization.
#. Track down several possibly-related problems with scheduling and
   timekeeping.
#. Fix other issues shown on the FreeBSD/EC2 status page.

FreeBSD as Home Theater PC
--------------------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/HTPC

| Contact: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org\ >

FreeBSD could be a much better platform for a Home Theater PC than it
currently is. We are focusing on improving support for media center
applications by extending the major ports (MythTV, VDR, XBMC) and
creating some documentation to guide interested people.

In the last months we continued to work on HTPC relevant ports, improved
lirc and multimedia/webcamd remote control support. The last missing
major HTPC application VDR (Video Disk Recorder) has finally been
committed to the portstree as multimedia/vdr including 17 vdr plugin
ports.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux Emulation Ports

| Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Emulation Mailinglist <freebsd-emulation@FreeBSD.org\ >

Old linux\_base ports (all which are not used by default in some
release) where marked as deprecated with a short expiration period. The
reason is that all those ports are long past their end of life and do
not receive security updates anymore. Unfortunately this is also true
for the linux\_base ports which are still used by default in the
releases, but no replacement is available ATM (see open tasks).

The linux-f10-pango port was updated to a more recent version whoch does
not have a security problem by generating a linux-RPM in a VM with
"FreeBSD" as the vendor (see the links section for a HOWTO).

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Decide which RPM based linux distribution+version to track next for
   the linux\_base ports, create ports for it and test for compatibility
   with our kernel code.

Portmaster
----------

URL: http://dougbarton.us/portmaster-proposal.html

Contact: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org\ >

The latest version of portmaster contains numerous improvements aimed at
large-scale enterprise users. Particularly, support for the
--index-only/--packages-only code has been significantly improved. Some
of the highlights include:

-  New --update-if-newer option which takes a list of ports and/or a
   glob pattern on the command line and only updates those that are out
   of date. This feature is very useful for ensuring that the packages
   needed for updating a system are all available and up to date on the
   package building system.
-  The portmaster.rc file can now be stored in the same directory as the
   script itself, which aids in shared access to the script (for example
   over an NFS mount)
-  More features now work (or work better) with --index-only, including
   --check-depends

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. I have received some support for items E.2 and E.3 on the web page
   listed above so I will be putting some effort into those areas in the
   coming months. I also have in mind to split out the "fetch" code to
   be its own script, in part to support goal E.2, and to allow for more
   efficient parallelization when downloading multiple distfiles
   (especially for multiple ports that download the same distfile). This
   will also allow me to set a global limit for the number of parallel
   fetches which should aid users on slow links.
