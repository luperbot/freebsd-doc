Clang replacing GCC in the base system
--------------------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/BuildingFreeBSDWithClang
|  URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/PortsAndClang

| Contact: Dimitry Andric <dim@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Pawel Worach <pawel.worach@gmail.com\ >

We imported newer snapshot of clang/llvm. This features quite a lot of
goodies. Most notably there's a new register allocator that brings much
better runtime performance. If you did a performance evaluation of
clang/llvm in the past now it's the time to rerun it with the new
register allocator!

There was some progress on Mips and PowerPC in addition to the usual
influx of improvements on ARM, i386 and amd64. We've managed to get
clang compiled arm kernel booting. ARM world is blocked by FreeBSD using
old ARM ABI.

We got a buildbot that periodically builds clang/llvm on FreeBSD and
FreeBSD (amd64 and i386) using clang/llvm, including booting the
resulting image.

We ran a few ports exp runs and got many ports bugs fixed so right now
we're able to build more than 15000 ports with clang. We expect this
number to grow rapidly as the problems are mostly trivial.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Fix your ports.
#. Performance evaluate the new clang/llvm.
#. Fix clang warnings in src.
#. Implement proper support for cross compiling.

--------------

Fix clang warnings
------------------

Contact: Ben Laurie <benl@FreeBSD.org\ >

In order to assist with the process of moving away from gcc, while I
learn the ropes of being a contributor, I am systematically fixing clang
warnings, so we can turn on -Werror again.

Down from > 42,000 warnings at the end of May to < 9,000 warnings now.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Always happy if someone else finds and fixes a warning!

libarchive, bsdtar, bsdcpio
---------------------------

URL: http://code.google.com/p/libarchive

| Contact: Tim Kientzle <kientzle@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Michihiro Nakajima <ggcueroad@gmail.com\ >

Libarchive, bsdtar and bsdcpio in 9-CURRENT have been updated to version
2.8.4 (thanks to mm@FreeBSD.org) and bsdtar now supports extracting XAR
and RPM archive formats.

There is ongoing development in trunk with many improvements including
support for new formats both on the read (e.g. cab, lha, rar) and write
parts (e.g. iso9660, xar).

The FreeBSD Foundation
----------------------

URL: `www.FreeBSDFoundation.org <www.FreeBSDFoundation.org>`__

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org\ >

We were a proud sponsor of BSDCan. We also sponsored 6 developers to
attend the conference. And, we brought in over $1,000 in donations! The
Foundation was also represented at FlourishConf in Chicago, IL and
SouthEast LinuxFest in Spartanburg, SC.

We acquired a non-exclusive copyright license to the `libcxxrt C++
runtime <http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/press/Pathscale-PRrelease.shtml>`__
software from PathScale.

Sponsored a project to create an `IPv6-only
version <http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/press/IPv6%20Day-PRrelease.shtml>`__
of FreeBSD and PC-BSD.

We're pleased announce the addition of Ed Maste to our Board of
Directors. Ed has been involved with FreeBSD since 2003. And, has been a
committer since 2005. Ed leads the OS team at Sandvine and is
responsible for a number of developers who bring enhancements from
FreeBSD into Sandvine's OS and contribute their own changes back to
FreeBSD.

We continued our work on infrastructure projects to beef up hardware for
package-building, network-testing, etc. This includes purchasing
equipment as well as managing equipment donations. In fact we just
placed an order for a 80-core server for SMP performance work.

Stop by and visit with us at Ohio LinuxFest, Columbus, OH, on September
10.

The work above, as well as many other tasks we do for the project,
couldn't be done without donations. Please help us by making a donation
or asking your company to make a donation. We would be happy to send
marketing literature to you or your company. Find out how to make a
donation at http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/donate/.

DIstributed Firewall and Flow-shaper Using Statistical Evidence (DIFFUSE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

| URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/
|  URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/downloads.html

| Contact: Sebastian Zander <szander@swin.edu.au\ >
|  Contact: Grenville Armitage <garmitage@swin.edu.au\ >

DIFFUSE is a system enabling FreeBSD's IPFW firewall subsystem to
classify IP traffic based on statistical traffic properties.

With DIFFUSE, IPFW computes statistics (such as packet lengths or
inter-packet time intervals) for observed flows, and uses ML (machine
learning) to classify flows into classes. In addition to traditional
packet inspection rules, IPFW rules may now also be expressed in terms
of traffic statistics or classes identified by ML classification. This
can be helpful when direct packet inspection is problematic (perhaps for
administrative reasons, or because port numbers do not reliably identify
applications).

DIFFUSE also enables one instance of IPFW to send flow information and
classes to other IPFW instances, which then can act on such traffic
(e.g. prioritise, accept, deny, etc.) according to its class. This
allows for distributed architectures, where classification at one
location in your network is used to control fire-walling or rate-shaping
actions at other locations.

The DIFFUSE prototype is a set of patches for FreeBSD-CURRENT that can
be downloaded from the project's web site. The web site also contains a
more comprehensive introduction, as well as links to related work and
documentation.

In July 2011, we released DIFFUSE v0.4. This release contains a number
of bug fixes and new features. Most notably we improved the
functionality of the tools used for training classification models, and
performing offline analysis.

DIFFUSE v0.4 is the last release, as the DIFFUSE project has concluded.
However, we may release bug fixes in the future if necessary.

--------------

FreeBSD IPv6-only Support
-------------------------

| URL:
  http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/project%20announcements.shtml#Bjoern
|  URL:
  http://www.ixsystems.com/ix/media/freebsd-foundation-and-ixsystems-announce-ipv6-only-testing-versions-of-freebsd-and-pc-bsd
|  URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/ipv6/ipv6only.html
|  URL: http://www.pcbsd.org/IPv6

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org\ >

As a follow-up work to the no-IP kernel, a FreeBSD IPv6-only prototype
kernel was build beginning of 2010. This work was now carried on and
merged to mainstream FreeBSD and will be part of the upcoming
9.0-RELEASE allowing for custom no-IPv4 kernels to be built. In addition
IPv6 installation and configuration support for FreeBSD and PC-BSD were
improved.

An IPv6-only kernel and continued efforts to build world without IPv4,
like FreeBSD had supported compiling out IPv6 for a long time, will
allow easier IPv6 validation work to happen. This will not only help
FreeBSD or FreeBSD-derived commercial product builders but we are also
hoping to motivate other Open Source projects to test their software for
IPv6-readiness on FreeBSD or PC-BSD.

We have provided and will continue to provide IPv6-only snapshots for
FreeBSD. In IPv6-only PC-BSD snapshots have been released to provide a
great Open Source desktop environment to test GUI applications for
IPv6-readiness as well.

I would like to thank the FreeBSD Foundation and iXsystems for their
support of the project, as well as George Neville-Neil for providing
review and Kris Moore for helping on the PC-BSD integration and building
and providing the PC-BSD snapshots.

--------------

IPv6 RA Handling Improvements
-----------------------------

Contact: Hiroki Sato <hrs@FreeBSD.org\ >

ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) message is a part of IPv6 Neighbor
Discovery Protocol in RFC 4861 and takes an important role in IPv6 basic
functionality. FreeBSD supports it in the kernel, and the rtadvd(8) and
rtsold(8) programs derived from KAME project handle it in userland.

This small project aims to improve the current RA handling by removing
limitations and adding new functionality found in the latest RFCs.
Changes committed are as follows:

-  FreeBSD now supports RA receiving even if net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
   and enabling/disabling the receiving in a per-interface basis. The
   traditional "host" and "router" node model in IPv6 RFCs is translated
   into a concept of "RA-receiving interfaces" and "RA-sending
   interfaces" in FreeBSD?9.0 or later, not depending only on
   system-wide IP forwarding capability. This is useful for a system
   with multiple IPv6-capable interfaces (such as a customer-edge
   router) which require SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)
   feature described in RFC 4862.
-  The rtadvd(8) and rtsold(8) programs now support IPv6 Router
   Advertisement Options for DNS Configuration in RFC 6106. This enables
   updating /etc/resolv.conf by using RAs.
-  The rtadvd(8) daemon now supports dynamically-added/removed
   interfaces. Although it was needed that all of RA-sending interfaces
   exist before the daemon was invoked, the new version no longer
   requires it. When a new interface arrived, it will be configured on
   the fly.
-  The rtadvctl(8) utility has been added. This displays RA-sending
   status on each interface and provides a way to control the daemon.
   This utility makes system administration much easier.

All of the changes described above have already been committed to
9-CURRENT and a part of them will be merged to 8-STABLE.

--------------

netmap
------

URL: http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/

Contact: Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@iet.unipi.it\ >

netmap is a novel framework to achieve wire-speed packet processing in
FreeBSD, while retaining the safety and richness of features provided by
the user space environment, and using only standard system calls. With
netmap, it takes as little as 70 clock cycles to move one packet between
the user program and the wire. As an example, a single core running at
900MHz can generate the 14.8Mpps that saturate a 10GigE interface. This
is a 5-10x improvement over the use of a standard device driver. netmap
is implemented with a relatively small kernel device driver (less than
2000 lines of code), plus individual network card patches (300-500 lines
each; currently supported are Intel 1 and 10 Gbit cards, and RealTek 1
Gbit cards). No special user libraries are needed, although we have a
small libpcap-over-netmap which enables the use of existing applications
on top of the new API with no source or binary modifications. The netmap
home page contains a more detailed description of the project, source
code, papers and slides.

--------------

New ipfw features
-----------------

URL: http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/base?view=revision&revision=223666

Contact: Vadim Goncharov <vadim_nuclight@mail.ru\ >

The
`ipfw(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+9.0-RELEASE>`__
packet filter now supports ``call`` and ``return`` rule actions. When a
packet matches a rule with the ``call`` action, the rule number is saved
in the internal stack and rules processing continues from the first rule
with specified number (similar to ``skipto`` action, but backward jumps
are allowed). If later a rule with ``return`` action is encountered, the
processing returns to the first rule with number greater than the number
saved in the internal stack. This makes it possible to organize
"subroutines" with rules, e.g. to call one subroutine several times from
different places in the ruleset. For more details, see
`ipfw(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+9.0-RELEASE&format=html>`__.

--------------

TCP User Timeout Option (UTO)
-----------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/CatalinNicutar/TCPUTO
|  URL:
  http://p4web.FreeBSD.org/@md=d&cd=//depot/projects/soc2011/&dw=u&c=kml@//depot/projects/soc2011/cnicutar_tcputo_8/?ac=83

| Contact: Catalin Nicutar <cnicutar@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Bjoern Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org\ >

The goal of the User Timeout option is to allow an application to tweak
the time TCP waits for acknowledgements. Using UTO, an application can
choose the exact time it is willing to wait for data to be acknowledged.
Also, an application can suggest to its peer the time it should wait
before dropping the connection (the peer may or may not allow this).

As an example, a SSH client can request a large timeout (4 hours) for a
connection. After some time the client is disconnected, reconnecting 2
hours later (with the same IP). Due to UTO, the connection should still
be alive and any lost data should be retransmitted.

Current testing is done on TCP over IPv4. Timeouts can be limited by
global sysctls and an application can choose how to send or accept
timeout values via socket options. In addition to regression tests,
support has been added to telnet, ssh and netcat.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Regression tests for TCP over IPv6.
#. Add support to more userland applications.
#. Implement strategies and regression tests to handle and simulate DoS
   scenarios.

--------------

Intel GPU Driver
----------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/Intel_GPU

Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org\ >

The FreeBSD Foundation sponsored project to port the Linux kernel-mode
driver for Intel GPU progressed to the point where some machines can use
Xorg with ddx driver from the git head and latest Mesa. On my test
machine I was able to run uhexen2 and ioquake3.

Nonetheless, the driver is still in the early stages of debugging. Read
the wiki page for more details, guidelines on installation and initial
bug analysis.

Main efforts right now are directed on getting the required VM changes
into the base system, ideally before 9.0 is released.

--------------

OpenAFS port
------------

| URL: http://openafs.org
|  URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/afs

| Contact: Benjamin Kaduk <kaduk@mit.edu\ >
|  Contact: Derrick Brashear <shadow@gmail.com\ >

AFS is a distributed network filesystem that originated from the Andrew
Project at Carnegie-Mellon University. Since our last report, upstream
OpenAFS has updated to a 1.6.0pre6 release candidate, which is available
in the FreeBSD Ports Collection. We still expect the upcoming 1.6.0
release to be usable for regular client workloads (though not heavy
load). We have also made progress on integration with the bsd.kmod.mk
kernel-module-building infrastructure, with a working prototype
implementation. Further cleanup and testing is needed before it is ready
to be committed.

There are several known outstanding issues that are being worked on, but
detailed bug reports are welcome at port-freebsd@openafs.org.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Update VFS locking to allow the use of disk-based client caches as
   well as memory-based caches.
#. Track down races and deadlocks that may appear under load.
#. Integrate with the bsd.kmod.mk kernel-module build infrastructure.
#. Eliminate a moderate memory leak from the kernel module.
#. PAG (Process Authentication Group) support is not functional.

--------------

Overhaul of the mii(4)-subsystem
--------------------------------

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org\ >

The mii(4)-subsystem has been overhauled and fixes and enhancements from
NetBSD/OpenBSD since mii(4) originally has been ported over have been
merged. As a result a lot of code duplication and hacks have been
removed from the PHY drivers and we are now able again to share the
miidevs file with NetBSD. Due to KPI breakages the majority of this work
will not be merged back into 8-STABLE and earlier.

Additionally shorthand aliases for common media+option combinations as
announced by mii(4) have been added to the ifmedia code so that now one
can actually supply the media strings found in the dmesg output to
ifconfig(8). Support for this will be merged back to 8-STABLE prior to
8.3-RELEASE.

--------------

Status Report for NFS
---------------------

Contact: Rick Macklem <rmacklem@FreeBSD.org\ >

The new NFS client and server are no longer considered experimental and
will most likely be the default for FreeBSD?9.0. Included is support for
NFSv4.0 as well as NFSv3 and NFSv2. The NFSv4.0 support was tested at a
recent NFSv4 Interoperability Bakeathon held at CITI of the University
of Michigan. Also tested at the Bakeathon was a basic client
implementation of NFSv4.1 which will soon be available as a test patch
against the FreeBSD?9.0 kernel sources. If you are interested in testing
NFSv4.1, stay tuned to the freebsd-fs@FreeBSD.org mailing list.
zkirsch@FreeBSD.org and friends will be taking on a majority of the
NFSv4 server work while I concentrate on the client, with hopes that the
NFSv4.1 support will mature over the next year or so.

I will also be making a patch for an experimental aggressive client side
on-disk caching mechanism for NFSv4 I call Packrats available. An
announcement about this will be made on freebsd-fs@FreeBSD.org as well.

FreeBSD June 6th, 2011 Doc Sprint
---------------------------------

| URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/DocSprints
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~bcr/doc/sprints/20110606-final.html
|  URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~linimon/annotated_prs.docsprint.html
|  URL: http://openhelpconference.com/

| Contact: Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org\ >
|  Contact: Dru Lavigne <dru@FreeBSD.org\ >

On June 6, the FreeBSD documentation project held a doc sprint where a
number of documentation issues were discussed. The sprint took place
primarily in IRC channel #bsddocs on EFNet. Notes were taken in an
Etherpad document where all participants could concurrently edit them in
an easy to use interface. Parallel to the discussion, a number of doc
problem reports have been closed. There are still some doc PRs that have
been identified that could also be closed, because their original issue
was already committed but the PR is still open. This needs to be
investigated on a case by case basis.

Dru Lavigne brought in her experiences from the Open Help conference
that she was attending during the sprint. It would be good to have some
FreeBSD documentation people at a future Open Help conference to
exchange ideas with other open source documentation projects and how
they go about doing their work.

The primary discussion focused on the issues that have been talked about
at the documentation working group at BSDCan's DevSummit in May.
Subjects like converting the documentation repository from CVS to SVN,
the move from DocBook SGML to XML-based documentation as well as other
formats like RST (re-restructured text), and publication efforts of the
handbook in electronic and dead-tree form were thoroughly debated.

Overall participation was good, but we would like to have more
documentation folks to participate in future sprints. The next sprint is
planned before EuroBSDCon 2011 and will be announced in time so that
interested people can set aside some time for it. We also plan to
include different time zones so that we can have more input from various
areas. We hope to establish these kind of sprints on a regular basis to
deal with documentation issues that affect the whole community.

Thanks to everyone who participated and helped bring some of the issues
we talked about forward.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Schedule the next documentation sprint before the next EuroBSDCon and
   include different timezones.
#. Work on the todo items identified during the sprint.
#. Resolve open documentation problem reports identified to be fixed,
   but still open for some reason.

The www/ja and doc/ja\_JP.eucJP/books/handbook subtrees have constantly
been updated. During this period, many part of out-dated contents in the
www/ja subtree were updated to the latest versions in the English
counterpart. Thus most of the files in the subtree are already
synchronized with www/en at this moment, and this updating work will be
finished within this year.

For FreeBSD Handbook, translation work for the kernelconfig section was
just started. In addition, we are planning to translate the upcoming
release announcement because it is also important for Japanese people.

Open tasks:

FreeBSD on the Sony Playstation 3
---------------------------------

URL: http://people.freebsd.org/~nwhitehorn/ps3/

Contact: Nathan Whitehorn <nwhitehorn@freebsd.org\ >

The FreeBSD Playstation 3 port is now fairly mature and will be included
in the 9.0 release, starting with BETA2. Most internal devices,
including the USB ports, bluetooth, ethernet, and SATA devices are now
supported, and the operating system can be installed to and boot from
the internal hard disk.

There are several remaining pieces to the port (Wireless, Sound, X11,
and the SPUs), which may be interesting projects for those interested in
non-PC architectures.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Built-in wireless. The 802.11 wireless interface on the Playstation 3
   is multiplexed through the wired ethernet MAC and is currently
   unsupported.
#. The sound hardware is not currently supported.
#. The framebuffer driver does not currently support X11. This would
   involve writing a simple X11 framebuffer driver to connect to
   syscons.
#. The synergistic processing units (SPUs) on the Cell processor are not
   supported yet. They present an interesting model of heterogeneous
   computing, more suited for full treatment by a UNIX-type kernel than
   GPGPU computing: each SPU has a concept of user and supervisor mode,
   as well as interrupts, and can share MMU context with the main CPU
   cores. As such, they in principle can support a full UNIX process
   model.

FreeBSD/sparc64
---------------

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org\ >

-  The iommu(4) driver has been changed to take advantage of the
   streaming buffers of the host-PCI and host-SBus bridges if present,
   which in at least some configurations results in a modest performance
   improvement due to the caching of DMA transactions. As a
   prerequisite, the bus\_dma(9) usage of all drivers compiled as part
   of the sparc64 GENERIC kernel has been reviewed and fixed and in case
   of sound(4) and sym(4) at least worked around as necessary in order
   to be able to use the streaming buffers.
    Support for this will be merged back to 8-STABLE prior to
   8.3-RELEASE.
-  Following the update of the in-tree binutils to 2.17.50, which now
   for the first time include support for GNUTLS on sparc64 in the base,
   support for TLS relocations on sparc64 was added to rtld(1) and
   enabled in the base GCC and malloc(3).
-  Support and a workaround necessary for Sun Fire V890 equipped with
   UltraSPARC-IV was added.
    Support for these will be merged back to 8-STABLE prior to
   8.3-RELEASE.
-  The schizo(4) driver has been updated to also support the XMITS
   Fireplane/Safari to PCI-X bridges and a workaround for
   Casinni/Skyhawk combinations has been added. Chances are that the
   latter solves the crashes seen when using the on-board Casinni NICs
   of Sun Fire V480 equipped with centerplanes other than 501-6780 or
   501-6790.
    These changes have been merged back to 8-STABLE and will be part of
   8.3-RELEASE.
-  As part of the largeSMP project which had the goal of supporting more
   than 32 CPU cores in FreeBSD several parts of the sparc64 specific
   code had to be adapted mainly in the assembler bits but as a result
   now also supports more than 32 CPU cores.
-  On machines where we do not need to lock the kernel TSB into the dTLB
   and thus may basically use the entire 64-bit kernel address space,
   i.e. on machines equipped with UltraSPARC-III+ and greater CPUs, the
   kernel virtual memory was increased to not be limited by
   VM\_KMEM\_SIZE\_MAX and VM\_KMEM\_SIZE\_SCALE decreased to 1 allowing
   kernel to use more memory as for example useful for ZFS.
    These changes will be merged back to 8-STABLE prior to 8.3-RELEASE.
-  The shortcut taken in the code responsible for flushing user mappings
   from the TLBs of UltraSPARC-III and greater CPUs turned out to not
   scale well on MP-systems with more than 8 CPU cores and thus was
   re-written. As a result it now scales up to at least 16-way machines.
    These changes will be merged back to 8-STABLE prior to 8.3-RELEASE.

libvirt networking port
-----------------------

URL: http://www.libvirt.org/

| Contact: Jason Helfman <jhelfman@experts-exchange.com\ >
|  Contact: Daniel P. Berrange <berrange@redhat.com\ >

Libvirt, a Toolkit to interact with virtualization capabilities, has
been ported to FreeBSD, however the networking capabilities have been
disabled as they are incompatible with FreeBSD. Libvirt currently
supports connecting to many types of hypervisors, however it can be a
far more useful tool if the networking capabilities were ported to
FreeBSD.

In contacting Daniel P. Berrange, he was kind enough to advise on what
is required to port networking of libvirt to FreeBSD. His response is
paraphrased below:

There are two aspects to networking in libvirt:

-  The virtual network driver (in src/network/bridge\_driver.c) uses the
   Linux kernel's native 'bridge' functionality to provide an isolated,
   or routed, or NATed network connection to guests. There is a bridge
   device on the host created, and guest TAP devices are added to it.
   There is no physical ethernet device added to the bridge, and
   iptables is used to control whether the host OS routes traffic
   to/from the bridge & physical LAN.
    Porting bridge and bridge control functionality to FreeBSD would
   need to be done, and how to nat/routed/isolated guest configs and
   write a compatible version of bridge\_driver.c for FreeBSD.
-  The host interface driver (in src/inteface/netcf\_driver.c) uses the
   netcf library to manage configuration of host network interfaces to
   do things like bonding, vlans, bridging and controlling the
   interfaces availability. The core job is to port netcf to work with
   FreeBSD. A netcf backend that understands FreeBSD's networking
   configuration files and calls appropriate tools to bring interfaces
   online/offline would need to be created.

Both these jobs are pretty much independent, so can easily be done in
parallel.

#. Port bridge network driver for libvirt.
#. Port netcf driver for libvirt.

|  URL: https://github.com/DragonSA/portbuilder/blob/0.1.3/TODO

Contact: David Naylor <naylor.b.david@gmail.com\ >

I would like to introduce a project that has been in the works for the
last 3 years. From the projects README:

A concurrent ports building tool. Although FreeBSD ports supports
building a single port using multiple jobs (via MAKE\_JOBS), it cannot
build multiple ports concurrently. This tool accomplishes just that.

Some of its key features:

-  Concurrent port building
-  Load control
-  Top like UI
-  Persistent builds (by default)

Portbuilder originally used threads to control each port at each stage
of the build however the required locks resulting in deadlocks, and some
ports would not build correctly. To resolve those issues a rewrite was
done to use only a single thread, making all locking code redundant.
Thanks to the use of kqueue(2) the overhead of managing concurrent port
builds is minimal. Further work to reduce that overhead is underway.

Portbuilder is installable from ports under ports-mgmt/portbuilder, see
the README for usage details. Please note that this is considered BETA
quality, that the feature set and API are expected to change, and that
portbuilder may crash or fail to behave properly.

Open tasks:

Contact: Zhihao Yuan <lichray@gmail.com\ >

This project creates a multibyte aware nvi fork. While most of the
userland tools in the FreeBSD base system support multibyte encodings,
there is no pure-licensed nvi fork comes with sufficient multibyte
encoding (both Unicode and non-Unicode) support prior to this.

Currently, functionally, the new nvi is ready for testing. The
description is at https://github.com/lichray/nvi2/wiki (the patch is
deprecated). I will commit a new one latter.

The features dropped from nvi-1.79 are:

-  Perl and Tcl interpreter supports;
-  The whole Perl/Tcl/Tk scripting framework;
-  A third-party gtags support.

and the features adopted from nvi-1.81.6 includes:

-  Multibyte encoding supports (wchar\_t + libiconv + libncursesw);
-  fileencoding and inputencoding options;
-  Undocumented :vsplit command, which vertically splits the screen.

Many known bugs, incomplete code from nvi-devel are fixed. However, I
find a serious memory leaking (via valgrind) in the nvi-devel iconv
framework. This requires a careful review.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Reviews the iconv part and fixes the memory leak.
#. Ex scripts for testing. But it seems that I have no experience on
   that...
#. File encoding detection. My plan it to detect UTF-16 BOM first, then
   UTF-8. If all fails, uses locale. UTF-8 BOM is not supported by
   iconv, and we need to discuss whether we should support it in the
   editor.

Replacing the Regular Expression Code
-------------------------------------

URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/G%C3%A1borSoC2011

Contact: G?bor K?vesd?n <gabor@FreeBSD.org\ >

The current regular expression code in libc is quite outdated and does
not support wide characters. There are various open source regular
expression libraries but replacing the code is not a simple task because
there are quite many considerations and requirements. The best candidate
is TRE, which is a BSD-licensed, supports wide and multibyte characters,
conforms to POSIX and it performs well compared to another available
alternatives, so the work has been started with TRE. Apart from the
replacement, the plan is to implement heuristical matching, which will
speed up the pattern matching significantly. Besides, grep and diff in
the base system have been using the GNU regex code, which has a more
permissive syntax. It is desired to have a single regex engine in the
base system, so the GNU syntax has to be implemented (as an optional
feature), as well.

So far, a fast string matching algorithm has been added, which is a
variant of the Turbo Boyer-Moore algorithm. It has been slightly tuned
to support not only literal patterns but patterns containing $^.
symbols. This algorithm is used automatically when the pattern makes it
possible.

Besides, heuristic matching has also been implemented. If the fast
matcher cannot be applied directly, it parses the pattern and separates
the fixed-length prefix and suffix of the pattern. Then it can be used
to locate the possibly matching regions of the text, using a more
efficient algorithm than the full regex NFA and the latter only has to
be applied to the narrow context that has been located.

Open tasks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Implement GNU regex syntax.
#. Add test suite GNU-specific behavior and also add some tests for
   locale-specific behavior.
#. Test and review the code. Contact the author and check if these
   improvements can be added to the upstream code so that more people
   can benefit from this.
