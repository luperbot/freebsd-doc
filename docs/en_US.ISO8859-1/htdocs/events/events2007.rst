   | *3 - 4 November, 2007*
   | COSCUP 2007 is a joint conference of ICOS (International Conference
     on Open Source), to make the open source carnival more exciting.
     The mostly change of COSCUP in 2007 is, the conference is
     co-organized by all local communities in Taiwan, we hope to enlarge
     the participation of local communities during such kind of
     cooperation. Just like the spirit of COSCUP, in this conference,
     you can be both attendee and promoter, and also involve the
     operation of the conference. The major topics in COSCUP 2007
     including web-based platform and embedded system due to the
     popularity of Web 2.0 and OLPC; the Chinese session, Lightning Talk
     and System session are the most interesting topics for years. There
     will be some presentations and talks about FreeBSD. The program is
     attractive just like before, we invite not only big ones in the
     community but also developers of non-famous local OSS projects, to
     get more people involved and make OSS more brilliant in Taiwan.

     UC Extension San Francisco: Room 216, South of Market Center, San
     Francisco, USA
   | *3 October, 2007*
   | The BSD community started at UC Berkeley in the late 1970's.
     Through the 1980's, the BSD software was developed and released
     from Berkeley. In 1992, Berkeley made its final release,
     4.4BSD-Lite, an open-source version of BSD. Since that time,
     independent development has continued by the FreeBSD, NetBSD,
     OpenBSD, Darwin, and Dragonfly projects. This talk traces the
     history and structure of the BSD community from its start as a
     small group of paid staff at Berkeley up through the thousands of
     volunteer developers that make up the FreeBSD Project of today. It
     describes how the development structure set up at Berkeley was
     expanded to create a self-organizing project that supports an ever
     growing and changing group of developers around the world.

     UC Extension Berkeley: Room 211, Golden Bear Building, Berkeley,
     USA
   | *29 September - 3 November, 2007*
   | This course will provide a firm background in the FreeBSD kernel.
     The course will cover basic kernel services, process structure, the
     FreeBSD jail facility for hosting virtual machines, scheduling,
     signal handling, and virtual and physical memory management. The
     kernel I/O structure will be described showing how I/O is
     multiplexed, special devices are handled, character processing is
     performed, and the buffer pool is managed. The implementation of
     the filesystem and its capabilities, including soft updates and
     snapshots, will be described. The filesystem interface will then be
     described to show how it can be used to support multiple filesystem
     types such as Sun Microsystem's Network File System (NFS). The
     course will also cover the FreeBSD socket-based network
     architecture, layering, and implementation. Socket communications
     primitives and internal layering will be discussed, with emphasis
     on the interfaces between layers; the TCP/IP implementation will be
     used as an example. A discussion of routing issues will be
     included. Other system-related topics include performance
     measurement, system tuning, and security issues. The presentations
     will emphasize code organization, data structure navigation, and
     algorithms. It will not cover machine-specific parts of the system,
     such as device drivers. Saturdays September 29, October 6 and 27,
     and November 3, 2007; 9:00AM to 5:30PM Sept. 29 to Nov. 3: Sat., 9
     am-5:30 pm (no meetings Oct. 13 and Oct. 20).

     Extension San Francisco: Room 216, South of Market Center, San
     Francisco, USA
   | *26 September, 2007*
   | Learn the history of the BSD (Berkeley Software Distributions) from
     one of its key developers, who brings the history to life, complete
     with anecdotes and footnotes to the historical narrative. The BSD
     community began at the UC Berkeley in the late 1970s. You'll hear
     about the triumphs and defeats of the project and its releases
     during its heyday in the 1980s. The Berkeley era concludes with the
     tumultuous lawsuit, ultimately settled in Berkeley's favor, which
     allowed the final release in 1992 of 4.4BSD-Lite, an open-source
     version of BSD. The talk includes a brief commentary on the
     FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, and Dragonfly projects that took
     their genesis from the release of 4.4BSD-Lite.
