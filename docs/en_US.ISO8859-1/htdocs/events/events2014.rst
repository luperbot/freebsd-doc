     Universit? de Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux, France
   | *8 - 10 October, 2014*
   | XDC is the annual conference where people working on the FOSS
     graphics stack meet. Talks cover projects status, work-in-progress,
     proposals for change, and so on. Like many similar conferences,
     this is a great opportunity for developers and users to talk face
     to face. For the first time in a long time, FreeBSD will be present
     and give a talk about the status of the graphics stack. The main
     goal is to re-establish communication with upstream, which tends to
     get Linux-centric these days.
