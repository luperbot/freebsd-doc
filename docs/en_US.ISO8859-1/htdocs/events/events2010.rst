   | *20 November, 2010*
   | This one-day event is to gather Central European developers of
     today's open-source BSD systems, popularize their work, and provide
     a real-life communication interface between developers and users.
     There are no formalities, no papers, and no registration or
     participation fee, however the invited developers are encouraged to
     give a talk on their favorite BSD-related topic. The goal is to
     motivate potential future developers and users, especially
     undergraduate university students to work with BSD systems.

   | A bugathon is an event coordinated by the FreeBSD bugbusting team.
     Bugathons are held on IRC (in the #freebsd-bugbusters channel of
     EFnet), and are attended by any interested FreeBSD developers and
     contributors during a week-end. They focus on closing as many
     problem reports and fixing as many bugs as possible. The plan for
     the seventh bugathon is to work through many of the problem reports
     in FreeBSD's GNATS database containing patches, with a view to
     either committing them, getting them into a committable shape, or
     explaining to the submitters the issues with the supplied patches.
