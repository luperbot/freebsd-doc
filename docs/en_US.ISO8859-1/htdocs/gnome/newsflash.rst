   This will be the last release of the GNOME 2.x series, mainly a
   bugfix and bridge release to the first release of the GNOME 3.x
   series.

   This release features commits by avl, marcus, mezz and myself.

   The FreeBSD GNOME Team would like to thank the following contributors
   and testers for there help with this release:

May 2010
========

-  \ **10 May, 2010:**

   Presenting GNOME 2.30.1 for FreeBSD. The official release notes for
   this release can be found at
   http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/

   This release brings initial PackageKit support, Upower (replaces
   power management part of hal), cuse4bsd integration with HAL and
   cheese, and a faster Evolution.

   Sadly GNOME 2.30.x will be the last release with FreeBSD 6.X support.
   This will also be the last of the 2.x releases. The next release will
   be the highly-anticipated GNOME 3.0 which will bring with it a new UI
   experience.

   Currently, there are a few bugs with GNOME 2.30 that may be of note
   for our users. Be sure to consult the 2.30 upgrade FAQ at
   `http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq230.html> <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq230.html>`__
   for specific upgrading instructions, and the up-to-date list of known
   issues.

   This release features commits by: avl, ahze, bland, marcus, mezz and
   myself.

   The FreeBSD GNOME Team would like to thank Anders F Bjorklund for
   doing the initial packagekit porting.

   And the following contributors and testers for there help with this
   release:

   | Eric L. Chen
   |  Vladimir Grebenschikov
   |  Sergio de Almeida Lenzi
   |  DomiX
   |  walder
   |  crsd
   |  Kevin Oberman
   |  Michal Varga
   |  Pavel Plesov
   |  Bapt
   |  kevin
   |  and Ion-Mihai Tetcu for running two exp-runs for us.

November 2009
=============

-  \ **28 November, 2009:**

   Presenting GNOME 2.28.1 for FreeBSD. The official release notes for
   this release can be found at
   http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.28/ . Officially, this
   is mostly a polishing release in preparation for GNOME 3.0 due in
   about a year.

   On the FreeBSD front, though, a lot went into this release. Major
   thanks goes to kwm and avl who did a lot of the porting work for this
   release. In particular, kwm brought in Evolution MAPI support for
   better Microsoft Exchange integration. Avl made sure that the new
   gobject introspection repository ports were nicely compartmentalized
   so that large dependencies aren't brought in wholesale.

   But, every GNOME team member (ahze, avl, bland, kwm, mezz, and
   myself) contributed to this release.

   Other major improvements include an updated HAL with better volume
   probing code, ufsid integration, and support for volume names
   containing spaces (big thanks to J.R. Oldroyd); a new WebKit; updated
   AbiWord; an updated Gimp; and a preview of the new GNOME Shell
   project (thanks to Pawel Worach).

   The FreeBSD GNOME Team would like to that the following additional
   contributors to this release whose patches and testing really helped
   make it a success:

   | Andrius Morkunas
   |  Dominique Goncalves
   |  Eric L. Chen
   |  J.R. Oldroyd
   |  Joseph S. Atkinson
   |  Li
   |  Pawel Worach
   |  Romain Tarti?re
   |  Thomas Vogt
   |  Yasuda Keisuke
   |  Rui Paulo
   |  Martin Wilke
   |  (and an extra shout out to miwi and pav for the pointyhat runs)

   We would like to send this release out to Alexander Loginov (avl) in
   hopes that he feels better soon.

April 2009
==========

-  \ **10 April, 2009:**

   | The FreeBSD GNOME team is proud to announce the release of GNOME
     2.26.0 for FreeBSD. The official release notes can be found at
     http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.26/ . On the FreeBSD
     front, we introduced a port of libxul 1.9 as an alternative for
     Firefox 2.0 as a Gecko provider. Almost all of the Gecko consumers
     can make use of this provider by setting:
   |  WITH\_GECKO=libxul
   |  The GNOME 2.26 port was done by ahze, kwm, marcus, and mezz with
     contributions by Joseph S. Atkinson, Peter Wemm, Eric L. Chen,
     Martin Matuska, Craig Butler, and Pawel Worach.

January 2009
============

-  \ **9 January, 2009:**

   The FreeBSD GNOME team is proud to announce the release of GNOME
   2.24.2 for FreeBSD. The official release notes can be found at
   http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.24/ . On the FreeBSD
   front, this release introduces Fuse support in HAL, adds multi-CPU
   support to libgtop, WebKit updates, and fixes some long-standing
   seahorse and gnome-keyring bugs.

   This release features commits by adamw, ahze, kwm, mezz, and myself.
   It would not have been possible without are contributors and testers:
   Alexander Loginov, Craig Butler, Dmitry Marakasov, Eric L. Chen,
   Joseph S. Atkinson, Kris Moore, Lapo Luchini, Nikos Ntarmos, Pawel
   Worach, Romain Tartiere, TAOKA Fumiyoshi, Romain Tartiere, Yasuda
   Keisuke, Zyl aZ, bf, Florent Thoumie, Peter Wemm, and pluknet.

March 2008
==========

-  \ **24 March, 2008:**

   The FreeBSD GNOME team is proud to announce the release of GNOME
   2.22.0 for FreeBSD. The official GNOME 2.22 release notes can be
   found at http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/ . On the
   FreeBSD front, this release features an updated hal port with support
   for video4linux devices, DRM (Direct Rendering), and better support
   of removable media. Work is also underway to tie webkit more closely
   into GNOME. As part of the GNOME 2.22 upgrade, GStreamer received a
   rather large upgrade as well. Be sure to consult UPDATING on the
   proper steps to upgrade all of your GNOME ports.

   This release would not have been possible without the contributions
   and testing efforts of the following people: Pawel Worach, kan,
   edwin, Peter Ulrich Kruppa, J. W. Ballantine, Yasuda Keisuke, and
   Andriy Gapon.

October 2007
============

-  \ **24 October, 2007:**

   Presenting GNOME 2.20.1 and all related works for FreeBSD. The
   official GNOME 2.20 release notes can be found at
   http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/ . Beyond that, this update
   includes the new GIMP 2.4 (courtesy of ahze).

   The GNOME 2.20 update also includes a huge change in the FreeBSD
   GNOME hierarchy. We are now using the more standard DATADIR of
   ${PREFIX}/share rather than ${PREFIX}/share/gnome. The result is that
   fewer patches and hacks are needed to port GNOME components to
   FreeBSD. This will mean some user changes may be required, so be sure
   to read /usr/ports/UPDATING for more details.

   This release and the things we accomplished in it would not have been
   possible without mezz's crazy idea to collapse DATADIR, and his
   persistence to make it happen successfully. Ahze and pav also deserve
   thanks for their work on porting modules and testing the whole ball
   of wax on pointyhat (respectively).

   The FreeBSD GNOME team would also like to thank our various testers
   and contributors:

   | Yasuda Keisuke
   |  Frank Jahnke
   |  Pawel Worach
   |  Brian Gruber
   |  Franz Klammer
   |  Yuri Pankov
   |  Nick Barkas
   |  Cristian KLEIN
   |  Tony Maher
   |  Scot Hetzel
   |  Martin Matuska (mm)
   |  Benoit Dejean
   |  Martin Wilke (miwi)
   |  (And anyone else I may have missed)

August 2007
===========

-  \ **4 August, 2007:**

   Okay, okay, I have missed a few updates. But the FreeBSD GNOME team
   has not been slacking. We've been keeping up with the latest GNOME
   development releases including this `latest
   one <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2007-August/msg00000.html>`__
   . Checkout the ports and `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__
   to see where GNOME 2.20 currently stands. Since 2.10 Beta 1 is right
   around the corner, now is also the time to start putting together
   some killer FreeBSD GNOME screenshots. Send all submissions to
   freebsd-gnome@FreeBSD.org .

June 2007
=========

-  \ **9 June, 2007:**

   The third release on the path to GNOME 2.20 is now available in both
   port and `package <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ forms. There is
   one known build issue with gnome-system-monitor and FreeBSD <
   7-CURRENT that we hope to have worked out soon. Along with this
   release comes the GNOME 2.20 (and beyond!)
   `roadmap <http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap>`__ . This will prepare you
   for the exciting new features in store for our favorite Desktop
   Environment.

May 2007
========

-  \ **31 May, 2007:**

   The next bug fix release for GNOME 2.18 has been
   `released <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2007-May/msg00004.html>`__
   and ports and `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are
   available for FreeBSD. So the only question is, why haven't you
   upgraded yet?

-  \ **6 May, 2007:**

   GNOME forges ahead with the first release in the development train
   that will become GNOME 2.20. As always, FreeBSD is right there with
   them. Only we bring a twist. This time around, we are doing yet
   another bit of housekeeping, and dropping the "share/gnome" DATADIR.
   This means that the FreeBSD GNOME installation will be more like all
   the other GNOME distributions. The net gain is that porting new GNOME
   applications to FreeBSD should be much easier with fewer hacks and
   patches.

   At this point, the `MarcusCom tree <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__
   is safe to use for most ports. There is still quite a few ports that
   still require conversion, and we will be working on those in the
   weeks to come. In particular, the Desktop and all gnome2 meta-ports
   are safe; and `Packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are
   available for the GNOME Desktop.

April 2007
==========

-  \ **11 April, 2007:**

   GNOME 2.18.1 has been
   `released <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2007-April/msg00008.html>`__
   and ports and `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are
   available for everyone's favorite operating system. This release is a
   polishing of 2.18.0, so expect a more stable, nicer looking desktop
   experience. On top of that, some of our users have also submitted
   `screenshots <../gnome/screenshots.html>`__ !

March 2007
==========

-  \ **19 March, 2007:**

   Presenting GNOME 2.18 for FreeBSD. GNOME 2.18 is a departure from
   recent GNOME releases in that it focuses more on stability and
   functionality than on new features. Not that it doesn't have its
   share of new and exciting items. Check out the `official release
   notes <http://www.gnome.org/start/2.18/>`__ for all the goodies in
   this release.

   GNOME 2.18 for FreeBSD would not have been possible without the hard
   work of the `FreeBSD GNOME Team <../gnome/contact.html>`__ and our
   intrepid band of testers including J. W. Ballantine, Pawel Worach,
   Yasuda Keisuke, Pascal Hofstee, miwi, Yoshihiro Ota, Vladimir
   Grebenschikov, Jukka A. Ukkonen, Phillip Neumann, Franz Klammer, and
   Neal Delmonico.

February 2007
=============

-  \ **28 February, 2007:**

   GNOME 2.18 is nigh! The 2.18 Release Candidate has been released, and
   both `ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are now available for
   FreeBSD. We are **SO** close to a release, and yet we still don't
   have any screenshots. So please, if you are testing GNOME 2.17, send
   us your best screenshot. If you need ideas on what to highlight,
   check out `the GNOME 2.18 release
   notes <http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointSeventeen/ReleaseNotes>`__ .

-  \ **14 February, 2007:**

   Where have we been?! While we haven't been updating the news page, we
   **have** been working on GNOME 2.17. We are pleased to announce that
   GNOME 2.17.91 (aka GNOME 2.18 Beta 2) is now
   `available <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ along with glorious
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ . We now request that all
   artistic people start submitting their GNOME 2.17 screenshots for our
   gallery.

January 2007
============

-  \ **31 January, 2007:**

   GNOME 2.16.3 was
   `released <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2007-January/msg00111.html>`__
   and ports are available for FreeBSD. This is the final release in the
   GNOME 2.16 series. The GNOME authors and the FreeBSD GNOME Team have
   made sure that this release rocks like none other. Packages will be a
   bit delayed for 2.16.3 as marcus is currently traveling. Expect
   packages to start showing up in the `FreeBSD GNOME
   Tinderbox <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ on February 8th.

December 2006
=============

-  \ **21 December, 2006:**

   GNOME 2.17.4 was
   `released <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2006-December/msg00005.html>`__
   just in time for Christmas. The one new module that is currently
   showing up in the FreeBSD port is
   `Tracker <http://www.gnome.org/~jamiemcc/tracker/>`__ . As soon as
   the final set of new GNOME 2.18 modules is ratified, they will be
   added to the various meta-ports. Additionally, work has mostly been
   completed on a clean up of the FreeBSD libgtop backend. This means
   that applications like gnome-system-monitor will become much more
   accurate on FreeBSD. As always,
   `ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are available to get you
   started with GNOME 2.17 testing.

-  \ **6 December, 2006:**

   The third installment on the road to 2.18 has been
   `released <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2006-December/msg00002.html>`__
   and we have cranked out the usual set of
   `ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ . If you are one of the
   brave testers, please continue to provide your feedback and `bug
   reports <../gnome/docs/bugging.html>`__ .

November 2006
=============

-  \ **29 November, 2006:**

   After seven months of development by Jean-Yves Lefort and Joe Marcus
   Clarke in MarcusCom CVS, the FreeBSD backend for
   `HAL <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal>`__ was finally
   `committed <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=hal.git;a=commit;h=76c310d0efb5d463f06291cb02100b3b3ce1da71>`__
   upstream into the HAL git repository. This means that future releases
   of HAL will have FreeBSD support out-of-the-box. This is a major
   landmark in a project that started on April 14, 2006 with the goal of
   bringing a better desktop experience to FreeBSD users.

-  \ **23 November, 2006:**

   GNOME 2.16 is maturing nicely with this
   `second <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2006-November/msg00062.html>`__
   bug fix and optimization installment. Additionally, thanks to our
   users, we have worked out quite a few bugs in the new HAL
   implementation. Don't just stand there! Upgrade already! Not a big
   fan of ports? Then try GNOME 2.16.2 from
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ .

-  \ **14 November, 2006:**

   The follow-on release to GNOME 2.17.1 is a more complete development
   snapshot. More of the new GNOME 2.18 features are starting to show
   up. For instance, this release features two new games: glchess and
   gnome-sudoku. `Ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are available for testing.

October 2006
============

-  \ **22 October, 2006:**

   No rest for the weary. No sooner had we gotten 2.16.1 into ports that
   2.17.1 was released. Being a .1 release, this is still very rough,
   and only a few of the components have been updated for the new
   development release. However, we still encourage our local guinea
   pigs...er...users to `try this out <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ .
   Not up for compiling this all yourself? That's cool, we have
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ pre-built with debugging
   symbols.

-  \ **14 October, 2006:**

   GNOME 2.16.1 is now available for FreeBSD, and it is in the ports
   tree in time for FreeBSD 6.2 (no you are NOT dreaming)! This is a
   first. Usually the GNOME release cycle has conflicted with the
   FreeBSD release cycle. However, thanks to Kris and pointyhat, we were
   able to get the major patch tested. In addition to the core GNOME
   ports, almost 500 ports were also touched to chase the GNOME move
   from X11BASE to LOCALBASE and fix build problems with the new
   freetype2. The bulk of the move was carried out by ahze, mezz, and
   pav, but it would not have been possible without cooperation from the
   FreeBSD KDE team who worked with us to make sure GNOME and KDE can
   still coexist happily. We would also like to send a shout out to kris
   and pointyhat for putting up with multiple test runs until we got
   something that was solid.

   Back to GNOME 2.16. This release brings a huge amount of new
   functionality to FreeBSD. Check out the standard `release
   notes <http://www.gnome.org/start/2.16/>`__ to get the official spiel
   from the GNOME camp. But on top of what you will read there, jylefort
   and marcus have completed work on a port of HAL to FreeBSD. This will
   allow FreeBSD to take advantage of closer hardware interaction such
   as auto-mounting CD-ROMs, USB drives, and music players; auto-playing
   audio CDs; and managing laptop power consumption.

September 2006
==============

-  \ **17 September, 2006:**

   Quite possibly the most functional GNOME release ever is now
   available for FreeBSD. GNOME 2.16 features HAL support for FreeBSD
   which allows FreeBSD users to take advantage of automatic volume
   mounting, advanced power management, and more. In addition, many
   performance improvements have gone into GNOME, and the eye candy has
   definitely been improved. Check out the full set of `release
   notes <http://www.gnome.org/start/2.16/>`__ for all of the new
   goodies.

   Due to the fact that GNOME 2.16 will be the first GNOME release for
   FreeBSD to live in LOCALBASE, and because we are so close to the
   release of FreeBSD 6.2, GNOME 2.16 will not be committed to the ports
   tree until sometime in November most likely. In the meantime,
   `ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are available from
   MarcusCom.

August 2006
===========

-  \ **2 August, 2006:**

   The last update (\*sniff\*) to GNOME 2.14 has been released with a
   fresh
   `batch <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2006-August/msg00001.html>`__
   of bug fixes and translation updates. The
   `package <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ build is just starting, but
   ports are ready. But if you want some real fun, check out `GNOME
   2.15 <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ .

July 2006
=========

-  \ **27 July, 2006:**

   GNOME 2.16 Beta 1 has been released into its new home on FreeBSD:
   /usr/local (or LOCALBASE for l33t p0rters). The migration to
   LOCALBASE was quite smooth, but some ports still need adjustment.
   This latest development snapshot has an updated 2.16 module list
   (less Tomboy), and `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ for all
   supported versions of FreeBSD are ready. So what are you waiting for!

-  \ **15 July, 2006:**

   ...PREFIXes, that is. That's right, GNOME is leaving its home in
   X11BASE, and joining KDE (and a lot of other ports) in LOCALBASE.
   This is being done as part of an effort to collapse into one
   third-party package PREFIX as X11R6 is no longer as relevant as it
   used to be. All of the work is happening in the `MarcusCom ports
   tree <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ , so expect GNOME 2.16 under
   /usr/local. The work is going extremely well, and we expect to be
   fully moved and unpacked in time for GNOME 2.16 Beta 1 (aka 2.15.90).

-  \ **14 July, 2006:**

   What happened to .1, .2, and .3? Well, GNOME 2.15 had a pretty rough
   start, especially for FreeBSD. However, we now have a working GNOME
   2.15.4 along with `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ and a
   port of `HAL <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal>`__ !
   There are still some nasty problems in this release, so be sure to
   checkout the official 2.15.4 `release
   notes <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2006-July/msg00004.html>`__
   for workarounds.

May 2006
========

-  \ **31 May, 2006:**

   GNOME 2.14.2 has been released, and all the updates have made it into
   the FreeBSD ports tree. `Packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__
   are still being built. Be sure to read the 2.14.2 `release
   announcement <http://gnomedesktop.org/node/2693>`__ for a list of all
   the fixes, translations, and other goodies.

April 2006
==========

-  \ **29 April, 2006:**

   Even though 5.5 and 6.1 have not been released, the ports freeze has
   been lifted, and GNOME 2.14 has been merged into the ports tree.
   `Packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ built against the update
   ports tree will be available shortly. Be sure to check out the list
   of `known issues <../gnome/docs/faq214.html#q5>`__ as well as the
   2.14 `release notes <http://www.gnome.org/start/2.14/notes/en/>`__ .

-  \ **15 April, 2006:**

   In his latest `bsdtalk <http://bsdtalk.blogspot.com/>`__ podcast,
   Will Backman interviews Joe Marcus Clarke about the FreeBSD GNOME
   Project. The podcast is available at
   http://cisx1.uma.maine.edu/~wbackman/bsdtalk/bsdtalk032.mp3 .

-  \ **6 April, 2006:**

   While we are still waiting for the releases of FreeBSD 5.5 and 6.1,
   GNOME 2.14.1 has been released, an we are maintaining it in the ports
   module of the `MarcusCom CVS
   repository <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ . Ports and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are ready, and we have
   hammered out quite a few known issues for this release. Primarily,
   problems with GStreamer and OSS have been fixed as well as many
   crashes on amd64.

March 2006
==========

-  \ **16 March, 2006:**

   GNOME 2.14 and FreeBSD: it's what your computer would want. Read the
   `official release
   announcement <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2006-March/msg00053.html>`__
   for all the new goodies, fixes, and most importantly, performance
   improvements. Instructions for upgrading can be found on our
   `development branch FAQ <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ . After 5.5
   and 6.1 are released, we will put out the official announcement, and
   update the website with all new documentation; and of course, put
   GNOME 2.14 into the ports tree.

-  \ **1 March, 2006:**

   The GNOME 2.14 Release Candidate is out, and ports and packages are
   `ready <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ . It looks like GNOME 2.14.0
   will be out on time on March 15th. Now is the time to report any
   serious problems as well as submit GNOME 2.14 screenshots and splash
   screens.

February 2006
=============

-  \ **15 February, 2006:**

   Get your BETA 2 here! That's right, GNOME 2.14 Beta 2 has been
   released, and FreeBSD ports and packages are
   `ready <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ . We are trying to document
   (and hopefully eliminate) any and all bugs (especially crashers). So
   if you find anything wrong in this release, please `report
   it <http://bugzilla.gnome.org>`__ . We also need people to start
   sending in their FreeBSD GNOME 2.14 splash screen entries. So down
   your favorite energy drink, and get to work.

-  \ **9 February, 2006:**

   The last release from the GNOME 2.12 branch is
   `out <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2006-February/msg00019.html>`__
   with FreeBSD ports right behind it. The next GNOME Desktop release
   will be 2.14.0 which is due out on March 13. GNOME 2.12.3 is a bug
   fix and translation release.

-  \ **4 February, 2006:**

   It's BETA time! GNOME 2.13.90 (aka GNOME 2.14 Beta 1) has been
   released along with a hot batch of FreeBSD ports. While still a beta,
   this release looks pretty solid. One of the biggest known issues is
   that the new GConf schema layout leaves behind a lot of leftover
   files (see
   `#328623 <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328623>`__ for
   more details). This should be fixed by release time. We are entering
   crunch time, so please report any and all problems. Enjoy!

December 2005
=============

-  \ **15 December, 2005:**

   If you are wondering what to get for that special GNOME user on your
   Christmas list, look no further. GNOME 2.13.3 has been released, and
   ports and packages are `ready <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ . Most
   of the kinks from GNOME 2.13.2 have been worked out (in particular,
   all games should be functional now).

-  \ **1 December, 2005:**

   The latest stable GNOME release, 2.12.2, is now ready for your
   upgrading pleasure in both ports and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ formats. This is primarily
   a bug-fix release, but a few `new
   features <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2005-November/msg00062.html>`__
   made the cut.

November 2005
=============

-  \ **17 November, 2005:**

   The exciting new winter line of GNOME Desktops has been released, and
   ports are now available for FreeBSD. GNOME 2.13.2 features three new
   proposed desktop modules: atomix, fast-user-switch-applet, and
   gnome-screensaver, along with Firefox 1.5 as the base for Epiphany
   and Yelp. Testers to their mark,
   `go! <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__

-  \ **5 November, 2005:**

   Now that FreeBSD 6.0 is out the door, GNOME 2.12.1 has been merged
   into the FreeBSD ports tree. Check out the `official
   announcement <http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-gnome/2005-November/012608.html>`__
   for more information.
   `Packages <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ built
   against the update ports tree will be available shortly. Be sure to
   use the `upgrade
   script <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/gnome_upgrade.sh>`__ to handle
   the upgrade process!

October 2005
============

-  \ **6 October, 2005:**

   Even though we are still waiting for 6.0 to be released, GNOME 2.12.1
   has been released, and `ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ have been updated. At this
   point, most (if not all) of the FreeBSD-specific known issues have
   been resolved.

September 2005
==============

-  \ **10 September, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.12 and FreeBSD, together at last. Read the `official
   unofficial release
   announcement <http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-gnome/2005-September/012190.html>`__
   for instructions on upgrading. After 6.0 is released, we will put out
   the official announcement, and update the website with all new
   documentation.

August 2005
===========

-  \ **26 August, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.12 Release Candidate is
   `out <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2005-August/msg00003.html>`__
   ! Man were there a lot of problems to tackle in this one.
   Fortunately, everything should now be ironed out, and GNOME 2.12 is
   shaping up to be a solid release. Please
   `test <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ our ports and
   `packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ .

-  \ **11 August, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.12 Beta 2 is `upon
   us <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2005-August/msg00001.html>`__
   , and `ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ are now ready for
   FreeBSD. `Packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ for amd64 and
   i386 are forthcoming. For this release, we have introduced a new
   feature that "normalizes" the shared library versions for many of the
   major GNOME 2 components. This means that future updates will most
   likely not see a shared library version bump which will help
   tremendously with upgrades. Test like there's no tomorrow!

July 2005
=========

-  \ **28 July, 2005:**

   That's right, folks. GNOME 2.12 Beta 1 is now out, and
   `ports <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ have been updated for your
   testing pleasure. We also have a complete set of `Desktop
   packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ available for i386 and
   amd64. Don't forget to checkout the `GNOME 2.12 Preview
   Tour <http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/gnome-2-12/>`__ so you can see what
   to expect from your shiny new desktop.

-  \ **19 July, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.11.5 has been officially released, and ports are available
   for FreeBSD. `Packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ for i386 and
   amd64 are cooking as we speak. New modules for this release include
   evince and libgnomecups. `Test it <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__
   already!

-  \ **7 July, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.10.2 has been released, and FreeBSD ports are now up-to-date.
   This is primarily a bug-fix release for GNOME 2.10. All of the
   changes can be found in the `official release
   announcement <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2005-July/msg00019.html>`__
   . `Packages <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ for i386 and amd64 are
   forthcoming.

June 2005
=========

-  \ **29 June, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.11.3 has been released, and FreeBSD ports are ready with
   packages on the way! The FreeBSD GNOME team has been working like
   crazy to get this release out the door. Unfortunately, the GNOME
   project has not made any official release announcements, so this
   release only has one new module, gnomekeyringmanager. Get your copy
   now from our `development branch FAQ <../gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__
   .

-  \ **29 June, 2005:**

   Starting with GNOME 2.11, and continuing with the release of 2.12 and
   beyond, the FreeBSD GNOME team will no longer support the GNOME
   Desktop on FreeBSD 4.X. Some of lower-level components will be
   supported, however. FreeBSD 4.X lacks many of the features needed for
   a modern desktop, and there are now two stable 5.X releases with 6.0
   around the corner. If you haven't done so already, now would be a
   good time to upgrade to 5.X or 6.0.

April 2005
==========

-  \ **18 April, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.10.1 has been released, and FreeBSD ports are already to go.
   This release is primarily a bug fix and performance improvement
   release, but some new features have been added. In particular,
   pkg-config got an overhaul to cleanup library linkage. This caused
   some unexpected build failure fallout, but work is underway to
   correct the problems. All of the changes in GNOME 2.10.1 can be found
   in the combined `change
   log <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2005-April/msg00030.html>`__
   .

March 2005
==========

-  \ **12 March, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.10.0 has been released, and merged into the FreeBSD ports
   tree. We even beat the 5.4-RELEASE ports freeze! This new release is
   jam-packed with
   `changes <http://www.gnome.org/start/2.10/notes/rnwhatsnew.html>`__ ,
   including some brand new `goodies <../gnome/docs/faq212.html#q1>`__
   now available on FreeBSD. Be sure to check out our `upgrade
   FAQ <../gnome/docs/faq212.html>`__ prior to jumping in. For those
   that do not want to spend time compiling, packages for i386 are
   almost done building on our
   `Tinderbox <../gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ .

-  \ **9 March, 2005:**

   The search for the FreeBSD GNOME 2.10 splashscreen is over. Thanks to
   all the artists that submitted
   `entries <http://people.FreeBSD.org/~adamw/images/gnome_splashes/>`__
   . Our `winning
   entry <http://people.FreeBSD.org/~adamw/images/gnome_splashes/franz_klammer-2.png>`__
   was designed by Franz Klammer (based on the default GNOME 2.10
   splashscreen by Sami "alump" Viitanen), and is the default GNOME 2.10
   splashscreen for FreeBSD. However, unlike previous release, all other
   entries have also been installed. You can use the
   deskutils/splashsetter port to choose the one you like best.

February 2005
=============

-  \ **22 February, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.8.3 has been released and the FreeBSD ports tree has been
   updated. `Packages for
   i386 <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are also
   freshly baked, and ready for your upgrade pleasure. All of the
   bugfixes, changes, and optimizations can be found in the `release
   announcement <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2005-February/msg00071.html>`__
   .

-  \ **11 February, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.9.91 (aka GNOME 2.10 BETA 2) has been released, and `ports
   are available <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__
   for your favorite OS. This release features the final set of GNOME
   2.10 modules. Please join us in heping to make this the best release
   since 2.8!

-  \ **7 February, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.10 is scheduled to be released on March 9, 2005, and we need
   talented artists to design a new FreeBSD GNOME splashscreen. The
   splashscreen should be in PNG format, feature both FreeBSD and GNOME,
   and work well with the scrolling application icons. The actual
   version of GNOME can be omitted if desired. Send all entries to
   gnome@FreeBSD.org . The FreeBSD GNOME user base will decide the
   winner, and the artist will be credited in the GNOME 2.10 commit log.

-  \ **3 February, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.9.90 (aka 2.10 BETA 1) has been released, and `ports are
   available <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ for
   FreeBSD. For this first beta, we have updated the module list to what
   should be the final list for GNOME 2.10. Now would be a good time to
   join the testing effort, and be sure to `send
   in <mailto:gnome@FreeBSD.org>`__ some screenshots if you do.

January 2005
============

-  \ **15 January, 2005:**

   GNOME 2.9.4 marks the first API/ABI frozen release of GNOME 2.9.
   GNOME 2.10 is still slated for release on March 9, so `test it
   already <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ ! GNOME
   2.9.4 also marks the first "clean" desktop release in that it leaves
   no leftover files or directories are deinstall. Checkout the
   `packages <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ for
   yourself.

December 2004
=============

-  \ **28 December, 2004:**

   The `Mozilla License
   Team <http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/licensing.html>`__ has
   `granted
   permission <http://people.freebsd.org/~ahze/firefox_thunderbird-approved.txt>`__
   to the FreeBSD Gnome Team for use of the *Firefox* and *Thunderbird*
   names, official icons, and use of the --enable-official-branding
   configure option.

-  \ **25 December, 2004:**

   HO, HO, HO, Merry Christmas! GNOME 2.9.3 has been released, and ports
   are now `available <docs/develfaq.html>`__ . This latest development
   release adds gnome-control-center, and should be quite usable.
   `Packages <docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ are also available for all
   supported i386 releases.

-  \ **11 December, 2004:**

   GNOME 2.8.2 has been released, and ports have been updated in the
   ports tree with `Tinderbox packages <docs/faq2.html#q21>`__
   forthcoming. A merged
   `ChangeLog <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2004-December/msg00026.html>`__
   is also available.

-  \ **4 December, 2004:**

   GNOME 2.9.2 has been released (such as it is), and ports for FreeBSD
   are now `available <docs/develfaq.html>`__ . Gnome-control-center and
   nautilus-media are still missing in action, but a lot of new modules
   including gnome-user-share, goobox, and totem-gstreamer have been
   added. If you like living on the edge, please help us with testing.

November 2004
=============

-  \ **24 November, 2004:**

   Although a bit late due to the 5.3 ports freeze, GNOME 2.9.1 has been
   brought to FreeBSD. This first 2.10 development release is not for
   the faint of heart. Due to changes in Nautilus, components such as
   gnome-control-center and nautilus-media will not work. However, if
   you have a strong constitution, please `join
   us <docs/develfaq.html>`__ in testing GNOME 2.9.

-  \ **7 November, 2004:**

   After being delayed waiting for FreeBSD 5.3-Release, GNOME 2.8 for
   FreeBSD is here! Be sure to use the gnome\_upgrade.sh script to
   handle your upgrade, and check out `the
   tinderbox <http://www.marcuscom.com/tinderbox/>`__ if you prefer
   packages. Visit `the FreeBSD/GNOME
   webpage <http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/>`__ for more information.

-  \ **6 November, 2004:**

   Michael Johnson has become the newest member of the FreeBSD GNOME
   team. He has shown an exceptional prowess for multimedia
   applications, but he will also be contributing to All Things GNOME.

October 2004
============

-  \ **26 October, 2004:**

   Although a bit late with the news release, GNOME 2.8.1 was released
   on October 26th, and FreeBSD ports have been
   `available <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/develfaq.html>`__ since
   then. Packages are also up on the
   `Tinderbox <http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q21>`__
   server. We are still holding off on the FreeBSD ports tree merge
   until after 5.3 is released.

September 2004
==============

-  \ **16 September, 2004:**

   The GNOME 2.8.0 Desktop has been released, and the FreeBSD ports are
   ready to go. However, bad timing has struck once again, and GNOME 2.8
   was released in the middle of the 5.3-RELEASE ports freeze.
   Therefore, GNOME 2.8 ports will not make it into the FreeBSD ports
   tree until after 5.3 is released. The good news is, this will give
   the FreeBSD GNOME team more time to do quality assurance so to give
   you the best upgrade experience possible. If you just have to have
   the updates now, you can get the GNOME 2.8 ports from our
   `development CVS server <docs/develfaq.html>`__ . Packages for i386
   will also be available soon from the `GNOME
   Tinderbox <docs/faq2.html#q21>`__ .

-  \ **16 September, 2004:**

   The BSD# Project has recently been formed on `Novell
   Forge <http://forge.novell.com>`__ and is devoted to porting and
   maintaining the Mono .NET framework from Ximian on FreeBSD. The Mono
   framework consists of not only the Mono runtime environment and
   compiler but the XSP webserver and Apache mod\_mono for handling
   ASP.NET applications, the IKVM Java virtual machine for handling Java
   within the .NET framework, and numerous data providers to access
   common library functions in C# or integration with existing C
   libraries. The project is currently in it's early stages but has
   recently finished ports for all the latest Mono packages distributed
   by Ximian. There is still much more work to be done; from fixing
   threading issues in the runtime environment, to wider testing of XSP
   and IKVM, to further understanding the framework and how it all
   functions. Those interested in Mono and the BSD# Project are asked to
   visit the project's
   `homepage <http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?bsd-sharp>`__
   and join the `mailing
   lists <http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/maillist/?group_id=1498>`__
   .

-  \ **16 September, 2004:**

   The BSD# Project is pleased to announce that the entire Mono 1.0.1
   .NET framework from Ximian has been ported for FreeBSD and is ready
   for use. In addition to an updated port of the Mono runtime, ports
   for all the latest library bindings, XSP and Apache mod\_mono for
   ASP.NET, and the IKVM Java VM for .NET have been made. Please be
   aware that due to changes in the latest Mono release and recent
   changes to threading in the 5.X branch of FreeBSD, these packages
   only work on 5.3-BETA versions and above. These ports are not
   currently available in the standard FreeBSD ports tree at the moment
   as they require wider testing but the intent is for them to be there
   soon. Those interested in Mono may use mono-merge script available
   from the `BSD#
   Project <http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?bsd-sharp>`__
   to merge the project's ports tree with their own.

-  \ **15 September, 2004:**

   Koop Mast became the newest member of the FreeBSD GNOME Team. He will
   focus mainly on Gstreamer. Please join us in welcoming Koop to the
   team!

-  \ **1 September, 2004:**

   GNOME 2.7.92 (aka 2.8 Release Candidate 1) has been released, and the
   FreeBSD port is right there waiting. This release has fixed most of
   the major headaches from 2.7.4, and users that were looking for a
   good time to upgrade should consider this a good time. All the
   details on how to obtain this release can be found in our
   `Development Branch FAQ <docs/develfaq.html>`__ . Packages for i386
   will be available shortly.

July 2004
=========

-  \ **24 July, 2004:**

   GNOME 2.7.4 has been released just five short days after 2.7.3, and
   the FreeBSD ports is ready to go. This latest release features a new
   desktop MIME system that is designed to integrate more closely with
   KDE. Unfortunately, not all of the GNOME applications have been
   converted over to it. All the details on how to obtain this release
   can be found in our `Development Branch FAQ <docs/develfaq.html>`__ .

-  \ **19 July, 2004:**

   GNOME 2.7.3 has been released, and the FreeBSD port has been updated
   as well. This is the first development release to have the full
   proposed modules list included. New GNOME desktop modules that are
   available for FreeBSD include evolution, gnome-nettool,
   gnome-keyring-manager, and vino. Those that like to run with scissors
   can check our `Development Branch FAQ <docs/develfaq.html>`__ for
   instructions on getting this release.

   FreeBSD. The server is still in its infancy, and a bit slow, but it's
   working constantly to provide the most up-to-date GNOME packages
   possible. As time goes on, other GNOME meta-ports will be added to
   the build.

-  \ **8 March, 2004:**

=============

-  \ **29 November, 2003:**

   The GNOME 2.4.1 desktop, the "Better late than never" release, is now

October 2003
============

-  \ **24 October, 2003:**

   Thanks to work by `Marcel Moolenaar <mailto:marcel@FreeBSD.org>`__ ,
   the GNOME desktop now builds on ia64. There are runtime issues to be
   resolved, but this was expected. Most importantly, we have new ways
   to exercise FreeBSD/ia64 in general and KSE/ia64 in particular. Not
   to mention that we can proceed porting and building other GNOME
   ports. GNOME for FreeBSD now runs on i386, Alpha, Sparc64, and ia64.

-  \ **16 October, 2003:**

   It's been one year since Adam Weinberger (aka adamw, aka lemniscate)
   signed his soul over to our project. Since then, project
   documentation readability is at an all-time high, we have more wacky
   GNOME games in the tree than ever before, and we're keeping up
   quicker with GNOME releases. Thanks, Adam!

July 2003
=========

-  \ **15 July, 2003:**

   The GNOME 1.4 Desktop has been removed from FreeBSD. Users are
   encouraged to upgrade to GNOME 2.2 which offers many improvements
   over the older desktop. This follows the GNOME announcement that
   development on the 1.4 desktop had stopped.

-  \ **12 July, 2003:**

   The GNOME 2.2.2 desktop has been released and ported to FreeBSD.
   GNOME 2.2.x is available in the main FreeBSD ports tree. Simply cvsup
   your ports, and upgrade. Packages may take a while, however. For
   details on what is new and what has been fixed, please see the GNOME
   2.2.2 `change
   log <http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1213&mode=thread&order=0>`__

   It's a bit late, but here none the less. For those willing to live on
   the edge, the next installment of the GNOME 2.3 development snapshot,
   code named "Daddy Walrus," has been ported. This snapshot lacks three
   ports found in the official GNOME distribution. They are gnopernicus,
   gnome-speech, and gnome-system-tools. The latter is missing because
   it does not fully work with FreeBSD, while the two former components
   rely on festival, which is broken on -CURRENT. To help out with the
   testing, checkout the \`\`ports'' module per the instructions at
   http://www.marcuscom.com:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi . Be sure to
   download the \`\`marcusmerge'' script as well to aid in upgrading

   FreeBSD port was updated accordingly. Update is strongly recommended
   to all current users.

-  \ **11 March, 2002:**

   All components of GNOME2 Development Platform already ported to
   FreeBSD have been updated to the latest versions found in the
   official GNOME2 beta2 distribution. Thanks to `Joe Marcus
   Clarke <mailto:marcus@marcuscom.com>`__ for his help.

February 2002
=============

-  \ **10 February, 2002:**

   The FreeBSD GNOME team started some initial work on getting GNOME2
   bits and pieces running on FreeBSD. The work is expected to take
   quite some time, though some initial set of ports making up core of
   the GNOME2 platform would be committed to the FreeBSD ports
   repository as soon as possible.
