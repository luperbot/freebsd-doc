   **What is new in GNOME 2.32?**

   Although the canonical summary of new features can be found at
   http://www.gnome.org/start/2.18/notes/en/, some of the most exciting
   new features of GNOME 2.32 are:

   -  Seahorse has been added to integrate OpenPGP with the Desktop.
   -  Improved system monitoring with a cleaned up FreeBSD backend for
      libgtop.
   -  Two new games: gnome-sudoku and glChess.
   -  Network support for many GNOME games.
   -  Lots of stability and performance improvements.

#. 

   **How do I upgrade to GNOME 2.32?**

   The answer is much simpler than it has been in the past:

   #. To build GNOME 2.32, you need to obtain the latest ports tree
      skeleton. This is most easily accomplished with ``portsnap(8)`` or
      `CVSup <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html>`__.
      Simply obtain the latest ports tree, and you are ready to go. Then
      do the following:

      ::

          # pkgdb -Ff
          # portupgrade -a
                

      Then you can run ``portupgrade(8)`` as you normally would.
      **NOTE:** it is recommended to run **portupgrade -a** to make sure
      you get all the necessary ports.

      If you are a ``portmaster(8)`` user, make sure you have least 1.9
      version. Then do the following:

      ::

          # portmaster -a
                

      Then run portmaster normally.

#. 

   **The upgrade failed; what do I do?**

   Unfortunately, this is not only possible, it is highly probable.
   There are many possible valid GNOME configurations, and even more
   invalid starting points. If the script fails, follow the instructions
   in the error message to let the FreeBSD GNOME team know about the
   failure.

   The majority of build failures will be dependency-related issues. One
   simple way to resolve the problem is to remove the offending port,
   re-run ``portupgrade`` or ``portmaster``, and then reinstall the port
   when the upgrade process is complete.

#. 

   **List of GNOME 2.32 problems and their solutions**

   Although GNOME 2.32 is certainly the best release to date (of
   course), there are a couple regressions that slipped in, both in the
   GNOME code and in its implementation within FreeBSD. Some of the more
   visible issues are:

   -  ``hald-addon-storage`` consumes file descriptors until it crashes.
      This is a known bug in FreeBSD, and only affects 6.0 and earlier
      and 5.5 and earlier. Users on those releases are encouraged to
      upgrade to FreeBSD 6.1 or later.
   -  **HAL** can not unmount and reset the da[0-9] devices associated
      with USB disks when you manually detach them from the system.
      Manually removing a USB umass device while it is mounted can
      result in a panic. This is a known bug in FreeBSD. See
      `kern/103258 <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=kern/103258>`__
      and
      `kern/89102 <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=kern/89102>`__
      for more details.

#. 

   **I have found a bug; whom should I alert?**

   Please read the FreeBSD GNOME Project's `documentation on reporting
   bugs <http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/bugging.html>`__.
