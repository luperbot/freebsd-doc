   **What is new in GNOME 2.32?**

   Although the canonical summary of new features can be found at
   http://www.gnome.org/start/2.14/notes/en/, some of the most exciting
   new features of GNOME 2.32 are:

   -  MUCH better performance
   -  Metacity now offers edge resistence
   -  Faster, more complete GEdit text editor
   -  Integrated gnome-screensaver with full XScreensaver module support
   -  Better and more stable multimedia support

#. 

   **How do I upgrade to GNOME 2.32?**

   The answer is much simpler than it has been in the past:

   #. To build GNOME 2.32, you need to obtain the latest ports tree
      skeleton. This is most easily accomplished with ``portsnap(8)`` or
      `CVSup <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html>`__.
      Simply obtain the latest ports tree, and you are ready to go. Then
      do the following:

      ::

          # pkgdb -Ff
          # portupgrade -o net/avahi -f howl
          # portupgrade -o x11/gnome-screensaver -f xscreensaver-gnome
                

      Then you can run ``portupgrade(8)`` as you normally would.
      **NOTE:** it is recommended to run **portupgrade -a** to make sure
      you get all the necessary ports.

   More detailed instructions are as follows:

#. 

   **The upgrade failed; what do I do?**

   Unfortunately, this is not only possible, it is highly probable.
   There are many possible valid GNOME configurations, and even more
   invalid starting points. If the script fails, follow the instructions
   in the error message to let the FreeBSD GNOME team know about the
   failure.

   The majority of build failures will be dependency-related issues. One
   simple way to resolve the problem is to remove the offending port,
   re-run ``gnome_upgrade.sh``, and then reinstall the port when the
   upgrade process is complete. In order to avoid having to build
   everything again, you can pass the ``-restart`` flag to
   ``gnome_upgrade.sh`` to resume a failed build.

#. 

   **List of GNOME 2.32 problems and their solutions**

   Although GNOME 2.32 is certainly the best release to date (of
   course), there are a couple regressions that slipped in, both in the
   GNOME code and in its implementation within FreeBSD. Some of the more
   visible issues are:

   There are currently no known issues with GNOME 2.32.

#. 

   **I have found a bug; whom should I alert?**

   Please read the FreeBSD GNOME Project's `documentation on reporting
   bugs <http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/bugging.html>`__.
