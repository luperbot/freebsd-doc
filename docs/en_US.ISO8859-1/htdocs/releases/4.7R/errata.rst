1 Introduction
==============

This errata document contains \`\`late-breaking news'' about FreeBSD
4.7-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the \`\`current errata'' for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 4-STABLE also contain up-to-date
copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see

2 Security Advisories
=====================

Buffer overflows in kadmind(8) and k5admin could potentially cause the
administrative server to execute arbitrary code. Bugfix and workaround
information can be found in security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-02:40 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:40.kadmind.asc>`__.

Errors in
`smrsh(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=smrsh&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__,
which could allow users to circumvent restrictions on what programs can
be executed, were fixed in FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE. Because the applicable
security advisory
(`FreeBSD-SA-02:41 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:41.smrsh.asc>`__)
was not issued after the release, this fact was not included in the
release notes.

Buffer overflows in the DNS
`resolver(3) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=resolver&sektion=3&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__,
which could cause some applications to fail, have been corrected. This
change was not mentioned in the release notes, as the applicable
security advisory
(`FreeBSD-SA-02:42 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:42.resolv.asc>`__)
was not issued until after the release.

Several vulnerabilities exist in the version of **BIND** included with
FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE. More information, including bugfixes and workaround
suggestions, can be found in security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-02:43 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:43.bind.asc>`__.

A file descriptor leak in the
`fpathconf(2) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fpathconf&sektion=2&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__
system call, can allow a local user to crash the system or cause a
privilege escalation. Bugfix information can be found in security
advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-02:44 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:44.filedesc.asc>`__.

Remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in **CVS** could allow an attacker
to execute arbitrary comands on a CVS server. More details can be found
in security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-03:01 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:01.cvs.asc>`__.

A timing-based attack on **OpenSSL**, could allow a very powerful
attacker access to plaintext under certain circumstances. This problem
has been corrected in FreeBSD 4.8-RC with an upgrade to **OpenSSL**
0.9.7. On supported security fix branches, this problem has been
corrected with the import of **OpenSSL** 0.9.6i. See security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-03:02 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:02.openssl.asc>`__
for more details.

It may be possible to recover the shared secret key used by the
implementation of the \`\`syncookies'' feature. This reduces its
effectiveness in dealing with TCP SYN flood denial-of-service attacks.
Workaround information and fixes are given in security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-03:03 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:03.syncookies.asc>`__.

Due to a buffer overflow in header parsing in **sendmail**, a remote
attacker can create a specially-crafted message that may cause
`sendmail(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sendmail&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running it,
typically ``root``. More information, including pointers to patches, can
be found in security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-03:04 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail.asc>`__.

The XDR encoder/decoder does incorrect bounds-checking, which could
allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service. For bugfix
information, see security advisory
`FreeBSD-SA-03:05 <ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:05.xdr.asc>`__.

3 Late-Breaking News
====================

Due to concerns over the licensing terms for the
`matcd(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=matcd&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__
driver uncovered late in FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE's release cycle, the
`matcd(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=matcd&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__
driver was removed. These issues are being addressed and this driver may
reappear in a future release of FreeBSD.

The ``srelease`` distribution contains object files for
`sysinstall(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysinstall&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__
in the ``release/sysinstall`` directory. These files were generated
during the release building process but, for some reason, were not
removed from the distribution files. They are harmless.

The
```databases/rdfdb`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/databases/rdfdb/pkg-descr>`__
and
```mail/ssmtp`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/mail/ssmtp/pkg-descr>`__
packages included in the 4.7-RELEASE package set cannot be installed
correctly. A workaround is to build and install these programs using the
Ports Collection.

The
```net/gnomeicu`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/net/gnomeicu/pkg-descr>`__
package included in the 4.7-RELEASE package set may not run correctly,
due to a missing dependency on the
```net/gnet`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/net/gnet/pkg-descr>`__
package. To work around this problem, install
```net/gnet`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/net/gnet/pkg-descr>`__
either from a package or the Ports Collection, preferably before
installing
```net/gnomeicu`` <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/net/gnomeicu/pkg-descr>`__.

The release notes for FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE incorrectly stated that the
``-J`` option to
`xargs(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=xargs&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__
is deprecated. In fact, there are no plans to remove this option.

`ftpd(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ftpd&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__
has a bug in its virtual hosting function triggered if ``/etc/ftphosts``
defines a virtual host whose IP address can resolve back to a hostname.
In that case the daemon will be exiting on ``SIGSEGV`` (signal 11) if
started from
`inetd(8) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=inetd&sektion=8&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-stable>`__,
or may malfunction unpredictably if running stand-alone. This bug has
been fixed in FreeBSD 4.8-RC.
