Commercial Vendors
==================

The power, flexibility, and reliability of FreeBSD attract a wide
variety of users and vendors. Below is a list of vendors offering
commercial products, services, and/or consulting for FreeBSD.

-  `Consulting Services <consult_bycat.html>`__ Whether you are just
   starting out with FreeBSD, or need to complete a large project,
   hiring consultants might be your answer. You can see the
   `alphabetical <consult.html>`__ list, or, if you prefer, view it by
   `categories <consult_bycat.html>`__.
-  `Hardware Vendors <hardware.html>`__ Need specialized tools, looking
   to buy a new desktop, or to fill a cage with rack mount servers that
   come with FreeBSD pre-installed? These companies may have what you
   need!
-  `Internet Service Providers <isp.html>`__ If you need webspace on a
   FreeBSD-based system or want your company connected to the internet,
   these companies may offer what you need!
-  `Miscellaneous Vendors <misc.html>`__ Books and accessories you just
   cannot live without!
-  `Software Vendors <software_bycat.html>`__ From audio players,
   network drivers, to commercial databases, FreeBSD has a wide variety
   of industrial strength software available. You can see the
   `alphabetical <software.html>`__ list, or, if you prefer, view it by
   `categories <software_bycat.html>`__.

If your company supports a FreeBSD related product, service, consulting,
or support that should be added to this page, please fill out a `problem
report <https://www.FreeBSD.org/support/bugreports.html>`__ in category
Documentation->Website. Submissions should contain a medium-sized
paragraph in length, describing your company. Please note that the
inclusion of vendors in our list does not signify our endorsement of
their products or services by the FreeBSD Project.
