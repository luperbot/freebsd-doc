[`FreeBSD, 2001 <bibliography.html#freebsd-committer>`__] has a number
of rules that committers should follow. However, it happens that these
rules are broken. The following rules exist in order to be able to react
to misbehaviour. They specify what actions will result in how long a
suspension the committer's commit privileges.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="itemizedlist">

-  Committing during code freezes without the approval of the Release
   Engineering team - 2 days

-  Committing to a security branch without approval - 2 days

-  Commit wars - 5 days to all participating parties

-  Impolite or inappropriate behaviour - 5 days

For the suspensions to be efficient, any single core member can
implement a suspension before discussing it on the “core” mailing list.
Repeat offenders can, with a 2/3 vote by core, receive harsher
penalties, including permanent removal of commit privileges. (However,
the latter is always viewed as a last resort, due to its inherent
tendency to create controversy). All suspensions are posted to the
“developers” mailing list, a list available to committers only.

It is important that you cannot be suspended for making technical
errors. All penalties come from breaking social etiquette.

Hats involved in this process:
