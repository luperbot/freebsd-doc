The FreeBSD Ports Collection is constantly changing. Here is some
information on how to keep up.

One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have already been
committed is by subscribing to
`FreshPorts <http://www.FreshPorts.org/>`__. Multiple ports can be
monitored. Maintainers are strongly encouraged to subscribe, because
they will receive notification of not only their own changes, but also
any changes that any other FreeBSD committer has made. (These are often
necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying ports
frameworkâ€”although it would be most polite to receive an advance
heads-up from those committing such changes, sometimes this is
overlooked or impractical. Also, in some cases, the changes are very
minor in nature. We expect everyone to use their best judgement in these
cases.)

To use FreshPorts, an account is required. Those with registered email
addresses at ``@FreeBSD.org`` will see the opt-in link on the right-hand
side of the web pages. Those who already have a FreshPorts account but
are not using a ``@FreeBSD.org`` email address can change the email to
``@FreeBSD.org``, subscribe, then change it back again.

FreshPorts also has a sanity test feature which automatically tests each
commit to the FreeBSD ports tree. If subscribed to this service, a
committer will receive notifications of any errors which FreshPorts
detects during sanity testing of their commits.
