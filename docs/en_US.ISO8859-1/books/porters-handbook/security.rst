Bugs are occasionally introduced to the software. Arguably, the most
dangerous of them are those opening security vulnerabilities. From the
technical viewpoint, such vulnerabilities are to be closed by
exterminating the bugs that caused them. However, the policies for
handling mere bugs and security vulnerabilities are very different.

A typical small bug affects only those users who have enabled some
combination of options triggering the bug. The developer will eventually
release a patch followed by a new version of the software, free of the
bug, but the majority of users will not take the trouble of upgrading
immediately because the bug has never vexed them. A critical bug that
may cause data loss represents a graver issue. Nevertheless, prudent
users know that a lot of possible accidents, besides software bugs, are
likely to lead to data loss, and so they make backups of important data;
in addition, a critical bug will be discovered really soon.

A security vulnerability is all different. First, it may remain
unnoticed for years because often it does not cause software
malfunction. Second, a malicious party can use it to gain unauthorized
access to a vulnerable system, to destroy or alter sensitive data; and
in the worst case the user will not even notice the harm caused. Third,
exposing a vulnerable system often assists attackers to break into other
systems that could not be compromised otherwise. Therefore closing a
vulnerability alone is not enough: notify the audience of it in the most
clear and comprehensive manner, which will allow them to evaluate the
danger and take appropriate action.
