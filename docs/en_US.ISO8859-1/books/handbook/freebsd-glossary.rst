ACPI Machine Language
    Pseudocode, interpreted by a virtual machine within an
    ACPI-compliant operating system, providing a layer between the
    underlying hardware and the documented interface presented to the
    OS.

ACPI Source Language
    The programming language AML is written in.

Access Control List
    A list of permissions attached to an object, usually either a file
    or a network device.

Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
    A specification which provides an abstraction of the interface the
    hardware presents to the operating system, so that the operating
    system should need to know nothing about the underlying hardware to
    make the most of it. ACPI evolves and supersedes the functionality
    provided previously by APM, PNPBIOS and other technologies, and
    provides facilities for controlling power consumption, machine
    suspension, device enabling and disabling, etc.

Application Programming Interface
    A set of procedures, protocols and tools that specify the canonical
    interaction of one or more program parts; how, when and why they do
    work together, and what data they share or operate on.

Advanced Power Management
    An API enabling the operating system to work in conjunction with the
    BIOS in order to achieve power management. APM has been superseded
    by the much more generic and powerful ACPI specification for most
    applications.

Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
Advanced Technology Attachment
Asynchronous Transfer Mode
Authenticated Post Office Protocol
Automatic Mount Daemon
    A daemon that automatically mounts a filesystem when a file or
    directory within that filesystem is accessed.

Base Address Register
    The registers that determine which address range a PCI device will
    respond to.

Basic Input/Output System
    The definition of BIOS depends a bit on the context. Some people
    refer to it as the ROM chip with a basic set of routines to provide
    an interface between software and hardware. Others refer to it as
    the set of routines contained in the chip that help in bootstrapping
    the system. Some might also refer to it as the screen used to
    configure the boostrapping process. The BIOS is PC-specific but
    other systems have something similar.

Berkeley Internet Name Domain
    An implementation of the DNS protocols.

Berkeley Software Distribution
    This is the name that the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at
    `The University of California at
    Berkeley <http://www.berkeley.edu>`__ gave to their improvements and
    modifications to AT&T's 32V UNIX?. FreeBSD is a descendant of the
    CSRG work.

Bikeshed Building
    A phenomenon whereby many people will give an opinion on an
    uncomplicated topic, whilst a complex topic receives little or no
    discussion. See the
    `FAQ <../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/misc.html#BIKESHED-PAINTING>`__
    for the origin of the term.

GUI
    See `Graphical User
    Interface <freebsd-glossary.html#gui-glossary>`__.

Giant
    The name of a mutual exclusion mechanism (a ``sleep mutex``) that
    protects a large set of kernel resources. Although a simple locking
    mechanism was adequate in the days where a machine might have only a
    few dozen processes, one networking card, and certainly only one
    processor, in current times it is an unacceptable performance
    bottleneck. FreeBSD developers are actively working to replace it
    with locks that protect individual resources, which will allow a
    much greater degree of parallelism for both single-processor and
    multi-processor machines.

Graphical User Interface
    A system where the user and computer interact with graphics.

    an extremely important part of the TCP/IP stack. Without the
    Internet Protocol, the Internet would not have become what it is
    today. For more information, see `RFC
    791 <ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc791.txt>`__.

Line Printer Daemon
Local Area Network
    A network used on a local area, e.g. office, home, or so forth.

Lock Order Reversal
    The FreeBSD kernel uses a number of resource locks to arbitrate
    contention for those resources. A run-time lock diagnostic system
    found in FreeBSD-CURRENT kernels (but removed for releases), called
    `witness(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=witness&sektion=4>`__,
    detects the potential for deadlocks due to locking errors.
    (`witness(4) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=witness&sektion=4>`__
    is actually slightly conservative, so it is possible to get false
    positives.) A true positive report indicates that “if you were
    unlucky, a deadlock would have happened here”.

    True positive LORs tend to get fixed quickly, so check
    http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current and the
    `LORs Seen <http://sources.zabbadoz.net/freebsd/lor.html>`__ page

Merge From Stable
    In the normal course of FreeBSD development, a change will be
    committed to the -CURRENT branch for testing before being merged to
    -STABLE. On rare occasions, a change will go into -STABLE first and
    then be merged to -CURRENT.

    This term is also used when a patch is merged from -STABLE to a
    security branch.

On-Demand Mail Relay
Operating System
    A set of programs, libraries and tools that provide access to the
    hardware resources of a computer. Operating systems range today from
    simplistic designs that support only one program running at a time,
    accessing only one device to fully multi-user, multi-tasking and
    multi-process systems that can serve thousands of users
    simultaneously, each of them running dozens of different
    applications.

Overtaken By Events
    Indicates a suggested change (such as a Problem Report or a feature
    request) which is no longer relevant or applicable due to such
    things as later changes to FreeBSD, changes in networking standards,
    the affected hardware having since become obsolete, and so forth.

Password Authentication Protocol
Perforce
    A source code control product made by `Perforce

    CVS. Although not open source, its use is free of charge to
    open-source projects such as FreeBSD.

    Some FreeBSD developers use a Perforce repository as a staging area
    for code that is considered too experimental for the -CURRENT
    branch.

Personal Computer
Personal Computer Network File System Daemon
Physical Address Extensions
    A method of enabling access to up to 64 GB of RAM on systems which
    only physically have a 32-bit wide address space (and would

Pluggable Authentication Modules
Point-to-Point Protocol
Pointy Hat
    A mythical piece of headgear, much like a ``dunce cap``, awarded to
    any FreeBSD committer who breaks the build, makes revision numbers
    go backwards, or creates any other kind of havoc in the source base.
    Any committer worth his or her salt will soon accumulate a large
    collection. The usage is (almost always?) humorous.

Portable Document Format
Post Office Protocol
    See Also `Post Office Protocol Version

    server to the client, as opposed to remaining on the server.

    See Also `Internet Message Access
    Protocol <freebsd-glossary.html#imap-glossary>`__.

PostScript Printer Description
Preboot eXecution Environment
Principle Of Least Astonishment
    As FreeBSD evolves, changes visible to the user should be kept as
    unsurprising as possible. For example, arbitrarily rearranging
    system startup variables in ``/etc/defaults/rc.conf`` violates POLA.
    Developers consider POLA when contemplating user-visible system
    changes.

Problem Report
    A description of some kind of problem that has been found in either
    the FreeBSD source or documentation. See `Writing FreeBSD Problem
    Reports <../../../../doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/problem-reports/index.html>`__.

Process ID
    A number, unique to a particular process on a system, which
    identifies it and allows actions to be taken against it.

Project Evil
    The working title for the NDISulator, written by Bill Paul, who
    named it referring to how awful it is (from a philosophical
    standpoint) to need to have something like this in the first place.
    The NDISulator is a special compatibility module to allow Microsoft
    Windows™ NDIS miniport network drivers to be used with FreeBSD/i386.
    This is usually the only way to use cards where the driver is
    closed-source. See ``src/sys/compat/ndis/subr_ndis.c``.

Random Access Memory
Revision Control System
    The *Revision Control System* (RCS) is one of the oldest software
    suites that implement “revision control” for plain files. It allows
    the storage, retrieval, archival, logging, identification and
    merging of multiple revisions for each file. RCS consists of many
    small tools that work together. It lacks some of the features found
    in more modern revision control systems, like CVS or Subversion, but
    it is very simple to install, configure, and start using for a small
    set of files. Implementations of RCS can be found on every major
    UNIX-like OS.

Recommended Standard 232C
    A standard for communications between serial devices.

Reduced Instruction Set Computer
    An approach to processor design where the operations the hardware
    can perform are simplified but made as general purpose as possible.
    This can lead to lower power consumption, fewer transistors and in
    some cases, better performance and increased code density. Examples
    of RISC processors include the Alpha, SPARC?, ARM? and PowerPC?.

repocopy
    See `Repository Copy <freebsd-glossary.html#repocopy-glossary>`__.

Repository Copy
    A direct copying of files within the CVS repository.

    Without a repocopy, if a file needed to be copied or moved to
    another place in the repository, the committer would run ``cvs add``
    to put the file in its new location, and then ``cvs rm`` on the old
    file if the old copy was being removed.

    The disadvantage of this method is that the history (i.e. the
    entries in the CVS logs) of the file would not be copied to the new
    location. As the FreeBSD Project considers this history very useful,
    a repository copy is often used instead. This is a process where one
    of the repository meisters will copy the files directly within the
    repository, rather than using the
    `cvs(1) <http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cvs&sektion=1>`__
    program.

Request For Comments
    A set of documents defining Internet standards, protocols, and so
    forth. See `www.rfc-editor.org <http://www.rfc-editor.org/>`__.

    Also used as a general term when someone has a suggested change and
    wants feedback.

Request To Send
    An RS232C signal requesting that the remote system commences
    transmission of data.
