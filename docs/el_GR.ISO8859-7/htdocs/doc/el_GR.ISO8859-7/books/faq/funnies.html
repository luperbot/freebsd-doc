Has anyone done any temperature testing while

            never seen a mention of FreeBSD. It seems to run really
            hot.</p><p>A. No, but we have done numerous taste tests on
            blindfolded volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of
            LSD-25 administered beforehand. 35% of the volunteers said that
            FreeBSD tasted sort of orange, whereas <span class="trademark">Linux</span>(R) tasted like purple
            haze. Neither group mentioned any significant variances in
	    temperature.  We eventually had to throw the
            results of this survey out entirely anyway when we found that
            too many volunteers were wandering out of the room during the
            tests, thus skewing the results.  We think most of the volunteers
            are at Apple now, working on their new <span class="quote">«<span class="quote">scratch and
            sniff</span>»</span> GUI. It is a funny old business we are in!</p><p>Seriously, both FreeBSD and <span class="trademark">Linux</span>(R) use the
            <acronym class="acronym">HLT</acronym> (halt) instruction when the system is
            idle thus lowering its energy consumption and therefore the
            heat it generates. Also if you have APM (advanced power
            management) configured, then FreeBSD can also put the CPU into
            a low power mode.</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idp78979152"></a><a id="letmeoutofhere"></a><p><strong>17.2.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Who is scratching in my memory banks??</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Q. Is there anything <span class="quote">«<span class="quote">odd</span>»</span> that FreeBSD
            does when compiling the kernel which would cause the memory to
            make a scratchy sound? When compiling (and for a brief moment
            after recognizing the floppy drive upon startup, as well), a
            strange scratchy sound emanates from what appears to be the
            memory banks.</p><p>A. Yes!  You will see frequent references to
            <span class="quote">«<span class="quote">daemons</span>»</span> in the BSD documentation, and what most
            people do not know is that this refers to genuine, non-corporeal
            entities that now possess your computer. The scratchy sound
            coming from your memory is actually high-pitched whispering
            exchanged among the daemons as they best decide how to deal
            with various system administration tasks.</p><p>If the noise gets to you, a good
            <code class="command">fdisk /mbr</code> from DOS will get rid of them,
            but do not be surprised if they react adversely and try to stop
            you. In fact, if at any point during the exercise you hear the
            satanic voice of Bill Gates coming from the built-in speaker,
            take off running and do not ever look back! Freed from the
            counterbalancing influence of the BSD daemons, the twin demons
            of DOS and <span class="trademark">Windows</span>(R) are often able to re-assert total control
            over your machine to the eternal damnation of your soul.
	    Now that you know, given a choice you would probably prefer to get
	    used to the scratchy noises, no?</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idp78987856"></a><a id="changing-lightbulbs"></a><p><strong>17.3.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>How many FreeBSD hackers does it take to change a

            is converted to heat which is vented through the heatsink
            / fan assembly.  This is why CPU cooling is increasingly
            important; as people get used to faster processors, they
            become careless with their data and more and more of it
            ends up in <code class="filename">/dev/null</code>, overheating
            their CPUs.  If you delete <code class="filename">/dev/null</code>
            (which effectively disables the CPU data sink) your CPU
            may run cooler but your system will quickly become
            constipated with all that excess data and start to behave
            erratically.  If you have a fast network connection you
            can cool down your CPU by reading data out of
            <code class="filename">/dev/random</code> and sending it off
            somewhere; however you run the risk of overheating your
            network connection and <code class="filename">/</code> or angering
            your ISP, as most of the data will end up getting
            converted to heat by their equipment, but they generally
            have good cooling, so if you do not overdo it you should be
            OK.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Paul Robinson adds:</em></span></p><p>There are other methods. As every good sysadmin knows,
            it is part of standard practice to send data to the screen
            of interesting variety to keep all the pixies that make up
            your picture happy. Screen pixies (commonly mis-typed or
            re-named as <span class="quote">«<span class="quote">pixels</span>»</span> are categorized by the type of hat
            they wear (red, green or blue) and will hide or appear
            (thereby showing the color of their hat) whenever they
            receive a little piece of food. Video cards turn data into
            pixie-food, and then send them to the pixies - the more
            expensive the card, the better the food, so the better
            behaved the pixies are. They also need constant stimulation
            - this is why screen savers exist.</p><p>To take your suggestions further, you could just throw
            the random data to console, thereby letting the pixies
            consume it. This causes no heat to be produced at all,
            keeps the pixies happy and gets rid of your data quite
            quickly, even if it does make things look a bit messy on
            your screen.</p><p>Incidentally, as an ex-admin of a large ISP who
            experienced many problems attempting to maintain a stable
            temperature in a server room, I would strongly discourage
            people sending the data they do not want out to the
            network. The fairies who do the packet switching and
            routing get annoyed by it as well.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="misc.html">Προηγ</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="advanced.html">Επόμενο</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Κεφάλαιο 16.
