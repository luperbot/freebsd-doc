Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the most frustrating experiences one can have as a
      software user is to submit a problem report only to have it
      summarily closed with a terse and unhelpful explanation like
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">not a bug</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bogus PR</span>”</span>.  Similarly,
      one of the most frustrating experiences as a software developer
      is to be flooded with problem reports that are not really
      problem reports but requests for support, or that contain little
      or no information about what the problem is and how to reproduce
      it.</p><p>This document attempts to describe how to write good problem
      reports.  What, you ask, is a good problem report?  Well, to go
      straight to the bottom line, a good problem report is one that
      can be analyzed and dealt with swiftly, to the mutual
      satisfaction of both user and developer.</p><p>Although the primary focus of this article is on FreeBSD
      problem reports, most of it should apply quite well to other
      software projects.</p><p>Note that this article is organized thematically, not
      chronologically, so you should read through the entire document
      before submitting a problem report, rather than treat it as a
      step-by-step tutorial.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="pr-when"></a>2. When to submit a problem report</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should
      engender a problem report.  Of course, nobody is perfect, and
      there will be times when you are convinced you have found a bug
      in a program when in fact you have misunderstood the syntax for
      a command or made a typographical error in a configuration file
      (though that in
      itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor
      error handling in the application).  There are still many cases
      where submitting a problem report is clearly
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the right
      course of action, and will only serve to frustrate you and the
      developers.  Conversely, there are cases where it might be
      appropriate to submit a problem report about something else than
      a bug——an enhancement or a feature request, for
      instance.</p><p>So how do you determine what is a bug and what is not?  As a
      simple rule of thumb your problem is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a
      bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">How do I do X?</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Where can I find
      Y?</span>”</span>).  It is not always quite so black and white, but the
      question rule covers a large majority of cases.  If you are looking
      for an answer, consider posing your question to the
      <a class="link" href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions" target="_top">FreeBSD general questions 郵遞論壇</a>.</p><p>Some cases where it may be appropriate to submit a problem
      report about something that is not a bug are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Requests for feature enhancements.  It is generally a
	  good idea to air these on the mailing lists before
	  submitting a problem report.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Notification of updates to externally maintained
	  software (mainly ports, but also externally maintained base
	  system components such as BIND or various GNU
	  utilities).</p><p>For unmaintained ports (<code class="varname">MAINTAINER</code> contains
	  <code class="literal">ports@FreeBSD.org</code>), such update notifications
	  might get picked up by an interested
	  committer, or you might be asked to provide a patch to update
	  the port; providing it upfront will greatly improve your chances
	  that the port will get updated in a timely manner.</p><p>If the port is maintained, PRs announcing new upstream releases
	  are usually not very useful since they generate supplementary work
	  for the committers, and the maintainer likely knows already there is
	  a new version, they have probably worked with the developers on it,
	  they are probably testing to see there is no regression, etc.</p><p>In either case, following the process described in <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/zh_TW.UTF-8/books/porters-handbook/port-upgrading.html" target="_top">Porter's
	  Handbook</a> will yield the best results.</p></li></ul></div><p>A bug that can not be reproduced can rarely be
      fixed.  If the bug only occurred once and you can not reproduce
      it, and it does not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are
      none of the developers will be able to reproduce it or figure
      out what is wrong.  That does not mean it did not happen, but it
      does mean that the chances of your problem report ever leading
      to a bug fix are very slim.  To make matters worse, often
      these kinds of bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives
      or overheating processors —— you should always try to rule
      out these causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</p><p>Next, to decide to whom you should file your problem
      report, you need to understand that the software that makes
      up FreeBSD is composed of several different elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by FreeBSD contributors, such as the kernel, the C library,
	  and the device drivers (categorized as <code class="literal">kern</code>);
	  the binary utilities (<code class="literal">bin</code>); the manual
	  pages and documentation (<code class="literal">docs</code>); and
	  the web pages (<code class="literal">www</code>).  All bugs in
	  these areas should be reported to the FreeBSD developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained
	  by others, and imported into FreeBSD and adapted.  Examples
	  include <span class="application">bind</span>, <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gcc&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">gcc</span>(1)</span></a>, and
	  <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sendmail</span>(8)</span></a>.  Most bugs in these areas should be reported
	  to the FreeBSD developers; but in some cases they may need to be
	  reported to the original authors instead if the problems are
	  not FreeBSD-specific.  Usually these bugs will fall under either
	  the <code class="literal">bin</code> or <code class="literal">gnu</code>
	  categories.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Individual applications that are not in the base system
	  but are instead part of the FreeBSD Ports Collection (category
	  <code class="literal">ports</code>).  Most of these applications are
	  not written by FreeBSD developers; what FreeBSD provides is merely
	  a framework for installing the application.  Therefore, you
	  should only report a problem to the FreeBSD developers when you
	  believe the problem is FreeBSD-specific; otherwise, you should
	  report it to the authors of the software.</p></li></ul></div><p>Then you should ascertain whether or not the problem is
      timely.  There are few things
      that will annoy a developer more than receiving a problem report
      about a bug she has already fixed.</p><p>If the problem is in the base system, you should first read
      the FAQ section on
      <a class="link" href="../../../../doc/zh_TW.UTF-8/books/faq/introduction.html#LATEST-VERSION" target="_top">
      FreeBSD versions</a>, if you are not already familiar with
      the topic.  It is not possible for FreeBSD to fix problems in
      anything other than certain recent branches of the base system,
      so filing a bug report about an older version will probably
      only result in a developer advising you to upgrade to a
      supported version to see if the problem still recurs.  The
      Security Officer team maintains the
      <a class="link" href="http://www.freebsd.org/security/" target="_top">list of supported
      versions</a>.</p><p>If the problem is in a port, note that you must first
      upgrade to the latest version of the Ports Collection and see
      if the problem still applies.  Due to the rapid pace of changes
      in these applications, it is infeasible for FreeBSD to support
      anything other than the absolute latest versions, and problems
      with older version of applications simply cannot be fixed.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="pr-prep"></a>3. Preparations</h2></div></div></div><p>A good rule to follow is to always do a background search
      before submitting a problem report.  Maybe your problem has
      already been reported; maybe it is being discussed on the
      mailing lists, or recently was; it may even already be fixed in
      a newer version than what you are running.  You should therefore
      check all the obvious places before submitting your problem
      report.  For FreeBSD, this means:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The FreeBSD

      tips and tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most
      effective.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp61609936"></a>4.1.

	    line empty.</em></span>  The PRs go both onto a mailing list
	    that goes all over the world (where the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span>
	    is used
	    for the <code class="literal">Subject:</code> line), but also into a
	    database.  Anyone who comes along later and browses the
	    database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject
	    line, tends just to skip over it.  Remember that PRs stay
	    in this database until they are closed by someone; an
	    anonymous one will usually just disappear in the
	    noise.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Avoid using a weak <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span>
	    line.</em></span>  You should not assume that anyone reading
	    your PR has any context for your submission, so the more
	    you provide, the better.  For instance, what part of the
	    system does the problem apply to?  Do you only see the
	    problem while installing, or while running?  To
	    illustrate, instead of <code class="literal">Synopsis: portupgrade is
	    broken</code>, see how much more informative this
	    seems: <code class="literal">Synopsis: port sysutils/portupgrade
	    coredumps on -current</code>.  (In the case of ports,
	    it is especially helpful to have both the category and
	    portname in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span> line.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you have a patch, say so.</em></span>
	    A PR with a patch included is much more likely to be
	    looked at than one without.  If you are including one,
	    put the string <code class="literal">[patch]</code> at the
	    beginning of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Synopsis</span>”</span>.  (Although it is
	    not mandatory to use that exact string, by convention,
	    that is the one that is used.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you are a maintainer, say so.</em></span>
	    If you are maintaining a part of the source code (for
	    instance, a port), you might consider adding the string
	    <code class="literal">[maintainer update]</code> at the beginning of
	    your synopsis line, and you definitely should set the
	    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Class</span>”</span> of

	its way to GNATS.  In particular, if your mailer automatically
	breaks lines, changes tabs to spaces, or escapes newline
	characters, any patch that you submit will be rendered
	unusable.  For the text sections, however, we request that
	you insert manual linebreaks somewhere around 70 characters,
	so that the web display of the PR will be readable.</p><p>Similar considerations apply if you are using the web-based
	PR submittal form instead of <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a>.  Note that

Attaching patches or files</h3></div></div></div><p>The following applies to submitting PRs via email:</p><p>The <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">send-pr</span>(1)</span></a> program has provisions for attaching
	files to a problem report.  You can attach as many files as
	you want provided that each has a unique base name (i.e. the
	name of the file proper, without the path).  Just use the
	<code class="option">-a</code> command-line option to specify the names
	of the files you wish to attach:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>send-pr -a /var/run/dmesg -a /tmp/errors</code></strong></pre><p>Do not worry about binary files, they will be automatically
	encoded so as not to upset your mail agent.</p><p>If you attach a patch, make sure you use the
	<code class="option">-c</code> or <code class="option">-u</code> option to
	<a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span></a> to create a context or unified diff (unified is
	preferred), and make
	sure to specify the exact CVS revision numbers of the files
	you modified so the developers who read your report will be
	able to apply them easily.  For problems with the kernel or the
	base utilities, a patch against FreeBSD-CURRENT (the HEAD
	CVS branch) is preferred since all new code should be applied
	and tested there first.  After appropriate or substantial testing
	has been done, the code will be merged/migrated to the FreeBSD-STABLE
	branch.</p><p>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment,
	note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of some
	email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will completely
	ruin anything intended to be part of a Makefile.</p><p>Do not send patches as attachments using
	<code class="command">Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</code>.
	These will perform character escaping and the entire patch
	will be useless.</p><p>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is
	generally all right——particularly when they fix the problem
	described in the PR——large patches and especially new code
	which may require substantial review before committing should
	be placed on a web or ftp server, and the URL should be
	included in the PR instead of the patch.  Patches in email
	tend to get mangled, especially when GNATS is involved, and
	the larger the patch, the harder it will be for interested
	parties to unmangle it.  Also, posting a patch on the web
	allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the entire
	patch in a followup to the original PR.  Finally, large
	patches simply increase the size of the database, since
	closed PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and
	simply marked as <code class="literal">closed</code>.</p><p>You should also take note that unless you explicitly
	specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any
	patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the
	same terms as the original file you modified.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp61788496"></a>4.4.

      however, at times GNATS runs behind and you may not get your
      email confirmation for 10 minutes or even longer.  Please try to
      be patient.</p><p>In addition, because GNATS receives all its input via email,
      it is absolutely vital that FreeBSD runs all its submissions through
      spam filters.  If you do not get a response within an hour or
      two, you may have fallen afoul of them; if so, please contact
      the GNATS administrators at <code class="email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href="mailto:bugmeister@FreeBSD.org">bugmeister@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code>
      and ask for help.</p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">注意: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the anti-spam measures is one that weighs against
	many common abuses seen HTML-based email (although not necessarily
	the mere inclusion of HTML in a PR).  We strongly recommend
	against the use of HTML-based email when sending PRs: not
	only is it more likely to fall afoul of the filters, it also
	tends to merely clutter up the database.  Plain old email is
	strongly preferred.</p></div><p>On rare occasions you will encounter a GNATS bug where a
      PR is accepted and assigned a tracking number but it does not
      show up on the list of PRs on any of the web query pages.  What
      may have happened is that the database index has gotten out of
      synchronization with the database itself.  The way that you
      can test whether this has happened is to pull up the
      <a class="link" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi" target="_top">
      view a single PR</a> page and see whether the PR shows up.
      If it does, please notify the GNATS administrators at
      <code class="email">&lt;<a xmlns="" class="email" href="mailto:bugmeister@FreeBSD.org">bugmeister@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</code>.  Note that there is a
      <code class="literal">cron</code> job that periodically rebuilds the database,
      so unless you are in a hurry, no action needs to be taken.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="pr-further"></a>7.
