	choice.  This trend accelerated greatly when Conner purchased Archive,
	a leading manufacturer of QIC drives, and then stopped production of
	QIC drives.  4mm drives are small and quiet but do not have the
	reputation for reliability that is enjoyed by 8mm drives.  The
	cartridges are less expensive and smaller (3 x 2 x 0.5 inches, 76 x 51
	x 12 mm) than 8mm cartridges.  4mm, like 8mm, has comparatively short
	head life for the same reason, both use helical scan.</p><p>Data throughput on these drives starts ~150 kB/s, peaking at ~500 kB/s.
	Data capacity starts at 1.3 GB and ends at 2.0 GB.  Hardware
	compression, available with most of these drives, approximately
	doubles the capacity.  Multi-drive tape library units can have 6
	drives in a single cabinet with automatic tape changing.  Library
	capacities reach 240 GB.</p><p>The DDS-3 standard now supports tape capacities up to 12 GB (or
	24 GB compressed).</p><p>4mm drives, like 8mm drives, use helical-scan.  All the benefits
	and drawbacks of helical-scan apply to both 4mm and 8mm drives.</p><p>Tapes should be retired from use after 2,000 passes or 100 full
	backups.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="backups-tapebackups-8mm"></a>17.9.2. 8mm (Exabyte)</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp88748240" class="indexterm"></a><p>8mm tapes are the most common SCSI tape drives; they are the best
	choice of exchanging tapes.  Nearly every site has an Exabyte 2 GB 8mm
	tape drive.  8mm drives are reliable, convenient and quiet. Cartridges
	are inexpensive and small (4.8 x 3.3 x 0.6 inches; 122 x 84 x 15 mm).
	One downside of 8mm tape is relatively short head and tape life due to
	the high rate of relative motion of the tape across the heads.</p><p>Data throughput ranges from ~250 kB/s to ~500 kB/s.  Data sizes start
	at 300 MB and go up to 7 GB.  Hardware compression, available with
	most of these drives, approximately doubles the capacity.  These
	drives are available as single units or multi-drive tape libraries
	with 6 drives and 120 tapes in a single cabinet.  Tapes are changed
	automatically by the unit.  Library capacities reach 840+ GB.</p><p>The Exabyte <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">Mammoth</span>"</span> model supports 12 GB on one tape
	(24 GB with compression) and costs approximately twice as much as
	conventional tape drives.</p><p>Data is recorded onto the tape using helical-scan, the heads are
	positioned at an angle to the media (approximately 6 degrees).  The
	tape wraps around 270 degrees of the spool that holds the heads.  The
	spool spins while the tape slides over the spool.  The result is a
	high density of data and closely packed tracks that angle across the
	tape from one edge to the other.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="backups-tapebackups-qic"></a>17.9.3. QIC</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp88756432" class="indexterm"></a><p>QIC-150 tapes and drives are, perhaps, the most common tape drive
	and media around.  QIC tape drives are the least expensive <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">serious</span>"</span>
	backup drives.  The downside is the cost of media.  QIC tapes are
	expensive compared to 8mm or 4mm tapes, up to 5 times the price per GB
	data storage.  But, if your needs can be satisfied with a half-dozen
	tapes, QIC may be the correct choice.  QIC is the
	<span class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span> common tape drive.  Every site has a QIC
	drive of some density or another.  Therein lies the rub, QIC has a
	large number of densities on physically similar (sometimes identical)
	tapes.  QIC drives are not quiet.  These drives audibly seek before
	they begin to record data and are clearly audible whenever reading,
	writing or seeking.  QIC tapes measure (6 x 4 x 0.7 inches; 152 x
	102 x 17 mm).</p><p>Data throughput ranges from ~150 kB/s to ~500 kB/s.  Data capacity
	ranges from 40 MB to 15 GB.  Hardware compression is available on many
	of the newer QIC drives.  QIC drives are less frequently installed;
	they are being supplanted by DAT drives.</p><p>Data is recorded onto the tape in tracks.  The tracks run along
	the long axis of the tape media from one end to the other.  The number
	of tracks, and therefore the width of a track, varies with the tape's
	capacity.  Most if not all newer drives provide backward-compatibility
	at least for reading (but often also for writing).  QIC has a good
	reputation regarding the safety of the data (the mechanics are simpler
	and more robust than for helical scan drives).</p><p>Tapes should be retired from use after 5,000 backups.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="backups-tapebackups-dlt"></a>17.9.4. DLT</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp88773328" class="indexterm"></a><p>DLT has the fastest data transfer rate of all the drive types
	listed here.  The 1/2" (12.5mm) tape is contained in a single spool
	cartridge (4 x 4 x 1 inches; 100 x 100 x 25 mm).  The cartridge has a
	swinging gate along one entire side of the cartridge.  The drive
	mechanism opens this gate to extract the tape leader.  The tape leader
	has an oval hole in it which the drive uses to <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">hook</span>"</span> the tape.  The
	take-up spool is located inside the tape drive.  All the other tape
	cartridges listed here (9 track tapes are the only exception) have
	both the supply and take-up spools located inside the tape cartridge
	itself.</p><p>Data throughput is approximately 1.5 MB/s, three times the throughput of
	4mm, 8mm, or QIC tape drives.  Data capacities range from 10 GB to 20 GB
	for a single drive.  Drives are available in both multi-tape changers
	and multi-tape, multi-drive tape libraries containing from 5 to 900
	tapes over 1 to 20 drives, providing from 50 GB to 9 TB of
	storage.</p><p>With compression, DLT Type IV format supports up to 70 GB
	capacity.</p><p>Data is recorded onto the tape in tracks parallel to the direction
	of travel (just like QIC tapes).  Two tracks are written at once.
	Read/write head lifetimes are relatively long; once the tape stops
	moving, there is no relative motion between the heads and the
	tape.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp88776528"></a>17.9.5. AIT</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp88777296" class="indexterm"></a><p>AIT is a new format from Sony, and can hold up to 50 GB (with
	compression) per tape.  The tapes contain memory chips which retain an
	index of the tape's contents.  This index can be rapidly read by the
	tape drive to determine the position of files on the tape, instead of
	the several minutes that would be required for other tapes.  Software
	such as <span class="application">SAMS:Alexandria</span> can operate forty or more AIT tape libraries,
	communicating directly with the tape's memory chip to display the
	contents on screen, determine what files were backed up to which
	tape, locate the correct tape, load it, and restore the data from the
	tape.</p><p>Libraries like this cost in the region of $20,000, pricing them a
	little out of the hobbyist market.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="idp88779728"></a>17.9.6.
