Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>Security is a function that begins and ends with the system
      administrator.  While all BSD <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>(R) multi-user systems have some
      inherent security, the job of building and maintaining additional
      security mechanisms to keep those users <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">honest</span>"</span> is
      probably one of the single largest undertakings of the sysadmin.
      Machines are only as secure as you make them, and security concerns
      are ever competing with the human necessity for convenience.  <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>(R)
      systems, in general, are capable of running a huge number of
      simultaneous processes and many of these processes operate as
      servers - meaning that external entities can connect and talk
      to them.  As yesterday's mini-computers and mainframes become
      today's desktops, and as computers become networked and
      internetwork, security becomes an even bigger issue.</p><p>Security is best implemented through a layered
      <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">onion</span>"</span> approach.  In a nutshell, what you want to do is
      to create as many layers of security as are convenient and then
      carefully monitor the system for intrusions.  You do not want to
      overbuild your security or you will interfere with the detection
      side, and detection is one of the single most important aspects of
      any security mechanism.  For example, it makes little sense to set
      the <code class="literal">schg</code> flag (see <a class="citerefentry" href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=chflags&amp;sektion=1"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">chflags</span>(1)</span></a>) on every
      system binary because
      while this may temporarily protect the binaries, it prevents an
      attacker who has broken in from making an easily detectable change
      that may result in your security mechanisms not detecting the attacker
      at all.</p><p>System security also pertains to dealing with various forms of
      attack, including attacks that attempt to crash, or otherwise make a
      system unusable, but do not attempt to compromise the
      <code class="systemitem">root</code> account (<span class="quote">"<span class="quote">break root</span>"</span>).
      Security concerns
      can be split up into several categories:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Denial of service attacks.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>User account compromises.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Root compromise through accessible servers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Root compromise via user accounts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Backdoor creation.</p></li></ol></div><a id="idp85676496" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp85677648" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp85679184" class="indexterm"></a><p>A denial of service attack is an action that deprives the
      machine of needed resources.  Typically, DoS attacks are
      brute-force mechanisms that attempt to crash or otherwise make a
      machine unusable by overwhelming its servers or network stack.  Some
      DoS attacks try to take advantage of bugs in the networking
      stack to crash a machine with a single packet.  The latter can only
      be fixed by applying a bug fix to the kernel.  Attacks on servers
      can often be fixed by properly specifying options to limit the load
      the servers incur on the system under adverse conditions.
      Brute-force network attacks are harder to deal with.  A
      spoofed-packet attack, for example, is nearly impossible to stop,
      short of cutting your system off from the Internet.  It may not be
      able to take your machine down, but it can saturate your
      Internet connection.</p><a id="idp85680080" class="indexterm"></a><p>A user account compromise is even more common than a DoS
      attack.  Many sysadmins still run standard
      <span class="application">telnetd</span>, <span class="application">rlogind</span>,
      <span class="application">rshd</span>,
      and <span class="application">ftpd</span> servers on their machines.
      These servers, by default, do
      not operate over encrypted connections.  The result is that if you
      have any moderate-sized user base, one or more of your users logging
      into your system from a remote location (which is the most common
      and convenient way to login to a system) will have his or her
      password sniffed.  The attentive system admin will analyze his
      remote access logs looking for suspicious source addresses even for
      successful logins.</p><p>One must always assume that once an attacker has access to a
      user account, the attacker can break <code class="systemitem">root</code>.
      However, the reality is that in a well secured and maintained system,
      access to a user account does not necessarily give the attacker
      access to <code class="systemitem">root</code>.  The distinction is important
      because without access to <code class="systemitem">root</code> the attacker
      cannot generally hide his tracks and may, at best, be able to do
      nothing more than mess with the user's files, or crash the machine.
      User account compromises are very common because users tend not to
      take the precautions that sysadmins take.</p><a id="idp85689424" class="indexterm"></a><p>System administrators must keep in mind that there are
      potentially many ways to break <code class="systemitem">root</code> on a machine.
      The attacker may know the <code class="systemitem">root</code> password,
      the attacker may find a bug in a root-run server and be able
      to break <code class="systemitem">root</code> over a network
      connection to that server, or the attacker may know of a bug in
      a suid-root program that allows the attacker to break
      <code class="systemitem">root</code> once he has broken into a user's account.
      If an attacker has found a way to break <code class="systemitem">root</code>
      on a machine, the attacker may not have a need
      to install a backdoor.  Many of the <code class="systemitem">root</code> holes
      found and closed to date involve a considerable amount of work
      by the attacker to cleanup after himself, so most attackers install
      backdoors.  A backdoor provides the attacker with a way to easily
      regain <code class="systemitem">root</code> access to the system, but it
      also gives the smart system administrator a convenient way
      to detect the intrusion.
      Making it impossible for an attacker to install a backdoor may
      actually be detrimental to your security, because it will not
      close off the hole the attacker found to break in the first
      place.</p><p>Security remedies should always be implemented with a
      multi-layered <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">onion peel</span>"</span> approach and can be
      categorized as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Securing <code class="systemitem">root</code> and staff accounts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Securing <code class="systemitem">root</code>-run servers
