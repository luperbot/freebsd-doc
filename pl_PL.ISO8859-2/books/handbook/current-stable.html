	FreeBSD-CURRENT users are expected to have a high degree of

	  This includes work in progress, experimental changes, and

	  FreeBSD developers compile the FreeBSD-CURRENT source code daily,
	  there are periods of time when the sources are not
	  buildable.  These problems are resolved as expeditiously as
	  possible, but whether or not FreeBSD-CURRENT brings disaster or
